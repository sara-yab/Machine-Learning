This repository includes three distinct machine learning projects:

Quality Prediction: Utilizes logistic regression to tackle binary classification problems on white wine quality and kidney disease datasets. The project involves enhancing model performance through feature selection, log transformation, and higher-order feature analysis, achieving accuracies of 73% and 75%, respectively.

Text Analysis: Focuses on classifying Reddit posts and comments into categories such as Trump, Obama, Musk, and Ford. It employs a range of classifiers, including Na√Øve Bayes and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with extensive hyper-parameter tuning and preprocessing techniques. The highest accuracy achieved was 97.59%, showcasing the effectiveness of MLP classifiers and advanced preprocessing methods.

Image Classification: Builds Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using PyTorch to classify images based on Japanese numbers. The project evaluates ResNet18, ResNet34, and VGG16 models on a dataset of Fashion-MNIST and Japanese digit images. It achieved a top accuracy of 91.00% in a Kaggle competition, ranking seventh among all submissions.
