Try resetting your KAM (Keep alive memory). See if it improves. Unplug one of your O2 sensors and reset KAM. Cold start the truck this should make your truck default the values learned over time and ignore O2 sensors. Does it run better? If no improvements are made you could also try unplugging MAF and doing same thing. Either way based on your numbers the PCM is subtracting fuel for some reason. Like vehicle is not getting enough air. Could be a faulty sensor or wiring but doesn't make sense if it warms up and is OK. Does Throttle plate move ok by hand? Those are some ideas to start out with.,Ford
"So I bought it 11 Days ago for Ford dealership (gold advantage) with additional 100k power train warranty for a new job with commute, but this error code popped up with an engine light.

"Trucks have governors, typically at 95-105 mph. They are definitely able to go faster if that is removed. The problem is they are limited because that is the top safe speed of some part. Typically max speed of tires are the limiting factor, but sometimes it's the driveshaft or maybe even something else.",Ford
"The trucks are electronically limited. If you get a supercharger you?ll probably have the option to remove the limiter for top end speed. 

While you *can* go faster once the governor is disabled, I don?t recommend it unless you have additional brake upgrades and high speed tires. And of course never, ***NEVER*** on public roads

Not that I?d recommend Roush anyways, their tune isnt the greatest and they leave plenty of power on the table. Most people who say they are gonna do this though, never actually do? so post updates",Ford
"Despite needing an alternator on my 2011 gasoline Fiesta the dealership wanted me to initially replace the throttle body first to remedy a code their scanner was throwing.

Just out of curiosity, do you live in an area with a lot of salt going on the roads to melt ice in the winter?",Ford
"That certainly is possible and bad fuel can cause it. But it?s on the dealership to prove that bad fuel is what caused it. On top of that, they may not be able to identify engine damage until they can get the truck running again. 

You just need to speak with them and ask them what the next steps are/is it covered under warranty. It if it, it?s paid for, if it?s not, have them explain why. If it?s from water in the fuel tank, have them put that information together and go talk to wherever you get fuel from.

"So there's some okay advice, and some terrible advice, here.  As someone who has recently been paid out due to a recurring issue that could not be cured despite repeated attempts by a dealership I feel I can provide solid advice.

Step 1:  Visit dealership after experiencing the issue.  Have this happen at least 3 times without the issue being fixed.

Step 2:  Call the 1-800 customer service number.  Explain the issue.  Be polite, but firm, that you want the issue cured under the warranty.  Get your CAS number and document who you spoke with!  Whatever customer service says to do... do it.

Step 3:  If not resolved after working with corporate customer service contact a ""Lemon Law"" lawyer.  You likely don't qualify under a state Lemon Law, but after repeated attempts you can sue under Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.

Step 4:  Work with lawyer, likely accept a settlement (this is what I did), receive check, then either sell the vehicle and refund the remaining portion of the extended warranty... or not.",Ford

"Take it to another dealership for a second opinion.  If you're stuck with this one, you will likely get the same results.  

You can also contact Ford regional about it.  

You can also take it back to the dealership, *yet again* and explain it to them that you will be taking them to court regarding the downtime that They/Ford have put you under since they cannot reliably fix this issue.

Maybe, on that last one, but hey, maybe it works...?

And yes, it's just a tad outrageous to ask for your money back... in the dealership/Ford's eyes.  

You will also want to check with your state's laws regarding lemon laws.  Here's [Texas' Lemon Law](https://www.txdmv.gov/motorists/consumer-protection/lemon-law).  However, it's under the NEW vehicle warranty, not under extended.  So here's your warranty on the 2019s from Ford](https://www.ford.com/cmslibs/content/dam/brand_ford/en_us/brand/resources/general/pdf/warranty/2019-Ford-Car-Truck-Warranty-version-1_frdwa_EN-US_04_2018.pdf).

Says the powertrain is covered for 5 years & 60K.  You're under all that at the moment... ostensibly.  Thing is if you bought it in, oh, October of 2018, you're done, but maybe MAYBE Ford will extend you.  If you bought it in June of 2019, then you're still in warranty... until June.

Although that'd be in Texas, if you're in Wisconsin or something, you'll need to look that up.  Also, the 5 year extended warranty shouldn't even go into effect until after the original warranties of the truck so it doesn't apply here, necessarily.  It already had a 5 year warranty after all.  That extended one's not a manufacturer's warranty, it's sort of an insurance policy, and it doesn't count with the lemon law in Texas.  Again, check your state's law.

"Diesel in passenger cars as a concept was ruined by the GM/Olds 350 diesel back in the early 80s. And now that diesel has largely lost is cost advantage with USLD and the cumbersome emissions controls, it will never really take hold here.

Coolant lines that run to the intake. They help warm the air going into the engine to help combustion and everything warm up a little faster. Probably disconnected and patched together just above the intake. Nothing related to your rough idle problem,Ford
"I read that you should cap those coolant lines on the intake. Why, I don't know as they shouldn't have vacuum but if a hairline crack happened inside the intake then it could cause a leak. Rough idle is a vacuum leak, spark or O2 most of the time. Try smoke to find the leak.",Ford
From the looks of the intake they were bypassed due to leaking coolant into the intake.  Could have a vacuum leak.  Spray some carb cleaner in there while the engine is running.  If a change in idle then there?s a leak,Ford
"Yeah idle hours certainly aren?t something most sales people are going to know to ?hide? from a customer unless maybe they specialize in fleet sales. And just an FYI, 1 hour of idle time equates to roughly 25 miles driven.",Ford
"Speaking from experience, 3,000 idle hours isn't shit for a vehicle like the F-150. For people buying Ford's police-spec cars, that's 3,000 is considered to be pretty low. It's common to see 6,000+ idle hours on a 100,000 mile motor. And most of those cars are Taurus or Explorer based, which have all of their components crammed into a smaller space (making more heat) and internal water pumps that are prone to failing.

Your F-150 should make it to 300,000+ fine if it's been maintained well and if you continue to maintain it well. The only thing I'd personally be worried about is your catalytic converters. All of the fleet cars I've ever owned have had a cat go bad, but that's it.",Ford
"I don't think most sales people even know what's up with that past the fact that some large vehicles do get engine runtime instead of an odometer.

Fun fact, my extended service contract company was willing to cover all the repairs except the actual cloth liner (almost $1500 as I recall) because that is technically ""Trim"".

"Power Steering pumps are pretty simple internally so they're easier to rebuild than something like an alternator.  It still depends on whom you purchase the reman from, but you'll have far better luck than you would with something like an alternator.",Ford
"The purge valve just occasionally forces the engine to pull a vacuum on the charcoal canister so it can accumulate more gasoline vapors.  You could unplug the thing and the engine will still start and run like nothing is amiss.  However, you won't pass an emissions check as your Check Engine Light will illuminate.  The vapor recovery system is a required piece of emissions control equipment in places that check emissions.

From the symptoms you're describing, your fuel pump is failing.  The giveaway is the problem rears its ugly head when you're low on fuel.  Fuel pumps on their last legs struggle to send enough fuel to the engine when the tank is low.  This is why cars with dead fuel pumps often end up at the mechanic with a 100% full fuel tank.

The dealer is throwing purge valves at your problem because they're stroking you.  Purge valve is $30 and easy to replace.  The Fuel pump is $180 and will take considerably more labor to repair.  They just want you unawares until the warranty's up.  Since purge valves are no longer making the problem go away, they put some gas in the car and go ""Huh, I have no idea what you're talking about.""

Take your car to an independent mechanic and get a detailed estimate of the issue.  Then take your car back to the dealership and say ""Look, you guys aren't finding the issue but this other mechanic inspected the car and found that this is my issue.""  You're going to have to come out of pocket to have the independent shop diagnose the problem, no way you can get around that.  But that third party diag will be cheaper than eating the entire repair cost.",Ford
"OP you?re not gonna be happy with this but read carefully. Ever get depressed about how fucked up our country is and how everything is seemingly designed to basically be a scam? Car warranties are one of those things. Including your factory warranty.

Dealer service centers get paid on what called book time. Book says 2 hour job, they charge 2 shop hours. But not for warranty repair. Warranty repair is often times half that. This means that pretty much *ANY* warranty repair you ever need work on will get swept under a rug by dealer service centers. They?re not interested in spending their time on your warranty problems when they can make double doing something else.

Wanna know something even worse? They likely never even touched the purge valve after the first time. They?re just banking warranty on that purge valve every time you come in.

Your only solution is to go to a different dealer and hope they actually give a shit about anything you tell them.",Ford
Nah I'm gonna disagree with everyone. OP do yourself a huge favor and replace the Fuel Pump Driver Module. There is an extremely good chance this is your issue.

OR, and hear me out now...  Make an actual Mustang with the electric drivetrain.

*horrified gasps abound* (or so I'm imagining...)

Let's be honest here now.  There are those people who want the Mustang experience, and would *love* an EV too... so why not get them together and make a Mustang GT-E?  Not hard.  Heck, you could even make it a hybrid, or gas-generator regen... or just full EV.

Really don't think it should carry the Mustang badging though. An electric Mustang should, imho, be just that. An electric MUSTANG. Like, I get the idea. The Mach-E is high performance. But it isn't a Mustang. The GT didn't get lumped into the Mustang branding, nor the Focus RS, so I don't really understand why the Mach-E did. But that's Ford's decision, another steed in the stable I suppose.

It's just not something very many people use. And it's uncomfortable and awkward when you do use it. I've had the split bench in my trucks for several decades and only used the center seat a few times.,Ford
"I'm going to preface what I'm about to say with the following: I 100% agree with everyone that the rear seat should still have 3 positions with the center optionally folding down into an arm-rest/console.  The rear seat should not be two captain's chairs with a fixed console.  The folded up back seat in my 2012 is way too useful to be wasted with a fixed console right in the middle being useless.

With that out of the way: Fuck. The. Front. Middle. Seat.  I have one, and the only thing I've used it for is as a dog barricade.  It is also a neat padded place to stash a laptop or tablet out of sight.  As a place for a human being to occupy: fuck that piece of shit.  The only thing worse than being forced to sit in that fucker is being forced to drive with someone sitting there.  Any child small enough to fit in that seat can't legally sit there because they're so small they require a car or booster seat anyway.  It isn't even useful for sliding across the cab because the bastard is too far forward for my 6' 5"" ass to cross the front seat with any modicum of grace.  It wasn't any less worthless in my 2000 Superduty crew cab.  I guess the flip up front console might be nice too if you have some sort of RSSI in your right elbow.",Ford
"By 6 passenger do you mean a crew cab without the huge center console in the front row or do you mean a 6 door version ?

If you mean the former, I totally agree.   Now that there is no transmission, why do these trucks need a transmission hump and what purpose does the huge center console serve ?

I used to have a Superduty with the 60/40 split front bench seat.   90% of the time the armrest was down.  But it sure was nice to be able to accommodate an extra passenger from time to time.",Ford

"I had a 2008 f-250 with the 6.4L from 2009 till 2012 when the engine failed. It did not give me any problems up until the engine failed at 250,000km. These engines are not really repairable in the normal diesel sense. Once the pistons go, usually between 200,000km and 300,000km, you need to replace it. Also, the emissions systems were not great in this generation, so if you can get away with deletes in your area, you should. 

If you are considering this, find out what a good quality replacement engine will cost you (installed), add it to the 6k purchase price, and see if you can find a 6.7L 2011 and up for that price. If it is a lot cheaper for the 6.4L, then go for it. If it will be a similar price to a 2011 and up, just buy the 6.7L. The 6.4L is arguably one of the worst engines Ford used vs the 6.7 is arguably one of the best. For those who will bring up the 7.3L diesel, if you were to remove all the emissions and turn the 6.7L down to the HP and Torque number of the 7.3L I honestly believe it would last just as long.

">This isn't typical, or acceptable behavior

I think the only unacceptable behavior here is you running your car to 'under 1/8th' on the fuel gauge and then acting surprised you ran out of gas.

What does that even mean? Like your mechanical fuel gauge was sitting at like 5% remaining? 

> In previous cars I could usually go 15 or more miles AFTER it read Distance to Empty

Again like, this seems like common behavior for you. Why are you running your cars so low? Not only does it lead to things like running out of gas, but it's also incredibly bad for your fuel pump to constantly be running on E. 

I mean it's your car so you can do whatever you want with it, but this is pretty much the definition of 'fuck around and find out.' Eventually running your car on fumes is going to come back and bite you. 

The digital 'distance to empty' is nothing but an estimation that can be thrown off by a ton of things. If it's saying 20 KM to empty but then you start driving way more aggressively, you're obviously going to get worse fuel economy and then the estimate might not be so accurate anymore.

My advice to you would be instead of throwing hundreds of dollars at your car looking for a 'problem,' quit running it on fumes. I'm not saying you need to fill it up at 1/2 tank, but trying to push your luck to see how far you can go after it reads 0 KM to empty is just relatively stupid.",Ford

"Here's a collage of various high frequency atmospheric energy harvesting ideas. 

The first at the left is the most interesting, but also the vaguest. The lower part is a self-charging capacitor using air as the dielectric. It's self-charging by using radioactive film electrodes. It could use alpha-emitter or electron and positron beta emitters. It likely also used secondary electron cascades (""delta rays""). The rod on top connects to a second capacitor between the two spherical knobs. The upper knob holds a negative charge collector. Guillemette doesn't describe it as a negative collector. That is what previous inventors called that arrangement. 

The negative charge collector concept was apparently first patented by Christofleau in 1921. It consists of a vertical magnet with its north pole pointed straight up surrounded by stiff wires that point up at an angle to vertical. The stiff wires are free to blow in the wind. Christofleau patented it for electroculture, which is the application of electric to agriculture. He combined the vertical negative collector with a horizontal positive collector, which consisted of a south pole of a magnet pointed north or south toward the equator. As with Roy Meyers' patent, the horizontal collector appears to be intended to harness charges that rotate as they move northerly/southerly through the atmosphere or ionosphere. 

Louis Montreuil also patented his collectors for electroculture. His collectors only use the horizontal points pointed toward the equator. 

Guillot's form appears to be an improvement of Christofleau's collectors incorporating coils on both collectors. The coils should make fields that oscillate with the current they collect. The combination of magnetic fields with the collectors is like Meyers. Guillot's devices may offer insight into how the aerial collector of the Roy J. Meyers device worked. Meyers' collectors are like positive collectors because they are horizontal. The Guillot device was said to generate ~3 KW with antenna height of ~20 m. Power depends on the total collector surface and height of the vertical antenna. His demonstration apparatus produced ~300 W with the collector raised 2 m. 

Moving on to the smooth collectors, the Deyo patent offers the clearest explanation of how it works. Apparently Deyo received special insight into Tesla's atmospheric energy harvesting concepts from Dr. John G. Trump, the MIT professor who knew Tesla and some of his secrets. Deyo's patent application says there is a high frequency electromagnetic vibration in the upper atmosphere between 4.5 and 7 MHz that can be harnessed. It must need to be stimulated to detect the power in it or else others would have noticed it already. 

The Kuntschar patents are another similar idea. It is a screened antenna to harness the solar wind and diffuse plasma of the atmosphere. There are other contemporary patent applications for these ideas.

"Here are a couple interesting patents that strongly appear related to Tesla's 1901 ""radiant energy"" atmospheric energy harvesting concept. That was an atmospheric charge collector that could be solar-powered or use x-rays, UV or other ionizing radiation to enhance the activity of the charge collector. The ionizing radiation used in the collector is the radiant energy. He used flat polished metal plates. Meyers uses these bent zinc plates. Honnef's patent doesn't mention any materials. 

The concept behind all these is that the positive charge of the atmosphere relative to ground is the product of positive ions, which represents energy that can be harnessed by atmospheric charge collectors. The charge doesn't need to be neutralized to harness it. The motion of the ions in the air is a current that may be harnessed. 

It's not clear how it works, but Meyers said he was able to produce >6 V and enough current to power the ignition of a gas engine (~2 A) with his initial experiment with the collectors at a low height. It produces AC at low voltage and high current. I colored the magnets so ambiguously because I was unsure how the poles were oriented, but rereading it I see the poles should face the horizon, but it still isn't clear if the top and bottom magnets have the same polarity or the opposite. It seems more likely they would be opposing to be oriented like the legs of the horseshoe magnet in the initial experiment.

His initial experiment apparatus shows the current passing thru coils on the horseshoe magnets, so the field of the magnets must be alternately strengthened and weakened with the alternating current. It's not clear how the current effects the magnets in his more advanced apparatus. 

The way it works with ambient ion motion somehow makes it need to be oriented in the geomagnetic field as shown. It seems like it must harness ions that are rotating as they move in a north-south direction in the geomagnetic field.

> Fig. 8 shows a simplified initial prototype, a magnet resonator with zinc plates positioned between the poles of a horseshoe magnet

> The tests which I have found successful with the apparatus seen in Figure 8 were carried out by the employment first of horseshoe magnets approximately 4 inches in length, the bar comprising the horseshoe being about one inch square, the zincs being dimensioned proportionately and from this apparatus with the employment of a single intensifier and rectifier, as above stated, I was able to obtain a constant current of 8 volts.

> It should be obvious that the magnets forming one of the electrodes of this apparatus may be permanent or may be electromagnets, or a combination of the two.

"To correct a small point in this, Tesla didn't think Marconi could signal across the Atlantic using only the single-tuned circuit radio transmitter and receiver that Marconi had patented, which is accurate. Marconi had to use Tesla's four-circuit system to succeed. The four-circuit/multi-stage resonance concept is necessary for sharp tuning at the transmitter and selective tuning at the receiver. Without the multi-stage resonant circuit concept, it requires impossibly huge amounts of power to overcome noise. 

Tesla first patented the two-stage resonant oscillator in 1896 ([US568178](https://www.google.com/patent/US568178)). He subsequently patented its use specifically for single-wire power transmission in 1897 ([US593138](https://www.google.com/patent/US593138)) and in 1899, surface wave power transmission and high-altitude plasma power transmission ([US649621](https://www.google.com/patent/US649621), [US645576](https://www.google.com/patent/US645576)). 

John Stone Stone patented the circuit for radio and he credited Tesla as the originator of the concept. 

Marconi used the four-circuit concept in violation of Tesla's patents, which was what the Supreme Court decided in 1943. http://www.mercurians.org/1999_Spring/rereading.htm

Besides the circuit dispute, there is also another aspect of this about free radio waves and surface waves. There are different kinds of electromagnetic waves useful for wireless signaling. Radio waves are freely radiated waves like light. Surface waves are not free. They propagate over earth's surface by conduction rather than radiation. With radio waves, the energy disperses exponentially with distance, but with surface waves, dispersion losses are at most linear.

The transmitter and receiver circuits are identical to use either type of wave. The only difference is the antenna and ground. For surface waves, the antenna shouldn't radiate. The aerial, if one is used, is only used as capacitance for the wave transmitted or received from the ground connection. Surface waves can use one or more ground connections or underground/underwater capacitor terminals or coils. The transmitter antenna can be different, but radio receivers receive both waves. This makes radio waves and surface waves easy to misidentify. They are also easily mistaken because radio waves give rise to surface waves as they travel through the atmosphere. At great distances like across an ocean, the surface wave can be the only wave detectable. This was the other point Tesla made about Marconi's transatlantic telegraphy. He thought Marconi was using surface waves rather than radio waves.

That fake quote is often presented along with one of Russell's diagrams. If Tesla had any connection to Russell, no one has ever said anything about it.

The first quote sounds like something Tesla could have said because he did point to the continuous spectrum of perceivable vibration from subsonic to sound to radio to heat to visible light and then ionizing light beyond that.

In a [1937 press release](https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/realm-science-tesla-who-predicted-radio-now-looks-forward-sending-waves-moon), Tesla may have provided some key details while he was talking about a mystery in contemporaneous cosmic ray research that had not yet been solved.

>While the origin and character of the rays observed near the earth's surface are sufficiently well ascertained, the so-called cosmic rays observed at great altitudes presented a riddle for more than 26 years, chiefly because it was found that they increased with altitude at a rapid rate. My investigations have brought out the astonishing fact that the effects at high altitudes are of an entirely different nature, having no relation whatever to cosmic rays. These [cosmic rays] are particles of matter projected from celestial bodies at very high temperature and charged to enormous electrical potentials. The effects at great elevations, on the other hand, are due to waves of extremely small lengths produced by the sun in a certain region in the atmosphere. This is the discovery which I wish to make known. 

>The process involved in the generation of the waves is the following: The sun projects charged particles constituting an electric current which passes through a conducting stratum of the atmosphere approximately 10 kilometers thick enveloping the earth. This is a transmission of energy exactly as I illustrated in my experimental lectures in which one end of a wire is connected to an electric generator of high potential, its other end being free. In this case the generator is represented by the sun and the wire by the conducting air. The passage of the solar current involves the transference of electric charges from particle to particle with the speed of light, thus resulting in the production of extremely shor",Musk
"The way the Wardencliffe tower worked has been buried under deliberate revisionist misinformation. The Wardencliffe tower was not a Tesla coil. It had a Tesla coil in its interior, but it acted just like Tesla described it, the equivalent of a water pump. The Wardenclyffe tower was extracting electricity from the Earth's electric field:  
http://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/~mcintyre/COURSES/ph431_F12/examples/EarthCharge.pdf  
  
If you see Tesla's calculations, he used Q for Coulombs and the D/d ratio which is the electric potential at the top of the tower to ground.  
  
The link below is one of the illustration's accompanying Tesla's articles in the Electrical Experimenter in 1919, which were drawn to his descriptions. Notice, there are no Tesla coil sparks from the hemisphere, which people have erroneously drawn-in over the years, equating them to wireless power transmitted through Hertzian waves (which doesn't work). Tesla described the Wardenclyffe tower as glowing, as well as those who witnessed it being tested at Shoreham in 1903. The only thing going to Shoreham in 1903 was the railroad and Thomas Edison would not run Edison Electric there until 1910. Yet, people living near Shoreham saw the glowing of the Wardenclyffe tower over the years from 1903 to 1907.

"This extremely simple device is basically a coaxial capacitor with electrodes made of unusual materials with some radon in the low pressure gas. The outer tube is made of palladium or carbon to absorb radon gas in the tube (and also absorb residual helium). The radon decays by fission to release alpha particles that are directed toward the central cathode where they produce secondary electrons by fusion and fission reactions with the cathode. The central cathode wire is a good secondary electron (delta ray) emitter like germanium, silicon or lead sulfide. Silver might work too especially with a semiconductive oxide or sulfide coating. The device needs to be charged by an external source to begin working. It works like a capacitor that multiplies charge by nuclear reactions. 

>[Abstract:] Alpha particles are directed and focused onto a delta-ray cathode target, where an alpha fusion reaction is generated. Delta radiation or high-energy secondary electrons are generated from the said alpha reaction. The cathode also becomes thermally active generating thermionic electrons. The electrons flow in the direction of an anode that absorbs their energy, generating electrical current in one direction, known in the electrical field as direct current.

>[From the summary:] The speed in which the present invention will build up power depends on the potential difference that is applied to it and type of radon gas that it contains. The quantity of the alpha particle source determines the amount of amperage that is generated. The target material 2 is also a determining factor of how much current will be generated. When the target material 2 temperature rises, a greater number of electrons are emitted from its surface. The heated cathode 2 increases the odds of alpha particles hitting head on with its atoms, thus, producing a greater number of alpha fusion reactions, which further increases the surface heat boiling off additional thermally generated electrons. The surface area of the cathode 2 and anode 3 is also a determining factor of how much electrical current will be obtained.

>The present invention generates a high voltage direct current. The present invention also generates a greater amperage per given density from what has been obtained from any previously known method or device in the prior art.

Perreault's website has some more information. He uses other old fashioned terms besides *delta ray* like *radiant energy*. https://www.nuenergy.org/ion-valve-technology-explained/ 

Back in the '90s, Bruce Perreault promoted his idea a lot. He even appeared on one of the daytime talk shows on broadcast television that were popular then. He didn't demonstrate a working prototype unfortunately. He said regulations forbade him from demonstrating devices containing radioactive substances. Of course this made it easy to doubt him. I first learned about Mr. Perreault's work from a friend when we were in middle school (in the '90s). I didn't really believe it until ",Musk

">The simplest form of nuclear battery is the Burke Cell ([US Patent # 3,939,366](http://patents.google.com/patent/US3939366), Ref. 4). [This patent for a betavoltaic type of nuclear power device was issued to Yasuro Ato and Soji Miyagawa of the Agency of Industrial Science & Technology of Japan, so I not sure why he referred to it as Burke Cell. If a Burke Cell is a device, I haven't seen anything about it. A [Holmes and Burke Cell](https://archive.org/details/voltaiccellitsc01benjgoog/page/n178) is apparently a type of zinc-acid battery, but that's probably unrelated.] This method consists of a conventional battery and a conventional load connected by means of a radioactive conductor. If we inspect this arrangement we find that all of the power dissipated in the load is not drawn from the battery. And upon closer examination we find that a current amplification occurs within the radioactive conductor (Ref. 3).

>This phenomenon is known as the Beta Voltaic Effect, and it may be explained by referring to Figure 6. For the simple case of this example, we will set the radioactive source (any alpha or beta emitter) external and separate from a silver wire. Now the battery from Figure 5 provides an electromotive force (emf) across the wire and consequently, conduction electrons within the wire are set in uniform motion. By definition, electricity is measured in terms of the number of charged particles (electrons) moving past a point in a unit of time and we call this amperes.

>The process by which a beta particle is absorbed, is such that the beta particle collides with the molecular structure of the copper, knocking electrons free. This electron avalanche occurs until the beta particle (electron) effectively comes to rest. A single beta particle emitted from strontium-90 that is absorbed in copper will generate 80,000 ions in a distance of 0.030 inches. Now, as soon as these electrons are knocked loose, they effectively become free electrons in the wire, and as such these additional electrons are acted upon by the emf applied across the wire to give the avalanche electrons a uniform direction of flow, regardless of their incident angle. This increase in the number of moving charged carriers is measured in the real world as increased current. We also measure a reduction in the resistance of the wire (Ref. 6), an increase in its conductivity (Ref. 7), while the current is directly proportional to the voltage (Ref. 8). In other words, the current goes up with an increase in voltage (Ref. 5). This is basically attributed to the increased emf acting on a greater number of avalanche electrons.

>Additionally, flux cutting also occurs as the beta particle approaches the current carrying wire which yields an emf to help drive electrons (Ref. 9).

>Now we will look at how we apply this phenomenon to our device. Figure 7 depicts a basic LC tank circuit comprised of an inductor and a capacitor. Theoretically, if this LC circuit were superconductive, then an e",Musk
"The effective inertial mass of electrons can be reduced so that they magnify induction. There are different ways of reducing the effective mass of electrons. One method is to irradiate normal conductors with radioactive particles. Another method uses light with photoconductive semiconductors like cupric oxide (CuO) to create excited photoelectrons. 

Reducing the inertial mass of electrons and using reduced mass electrons to amplify induction violates the simplistic normal understanding of Helmholt'z law of conservation of energy. Conservation of energy has been a useful concept, but it doesn't apply to all electromagnetic effects. It only applies to forces that have counteracting opposing forces, but not all effects do.

In this patent application, Barbat is patenting the photoconductive method, but he describes the radioactive method too. The radioactive method was used by Alfred M. Hubbard in 1919 but never patented. The same basic device was re-invented from descriptions of Hubbard's work decades later by Paul M. Brown who patented it in 1986 ([US4835433](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4835433)). This is the device that I usually call *resonant nuclear battery*, but *resonant nuclear power converter* would be more accurate. These devices use the same principle as E. Lemier's 1916 radium radio signal intensifier.

> Brown discusses the conversion of energy of radioactive decay products, principally alpha emissions, to electrical energy by amplifying electrical oscillations in a high-Q L-C circuit irradiated by radioactive materials. ?During the absorption process, each alpha particle will collide with one or more atoms in the conductor knocking electrons from their orbits and imparting some kinetic energy to the electrons in the conductor thereby increasing its conductivity.?

These concepts were apparently all originally invented by Tesla.

These principles can easily be applied to Tesla coil design to achieve superior results. Use bare wire instead of the unusual polyimide enamel wire for the high frequency air-core coils and shine the light and particle effluence from the spark gap onto one or more of the air-core coils. Tesla demonstrated this configuration in at least [one relatively unremarkable photo](https://teslauniverse.com/sites/default/files/styles/default_extra_large_watermark/public/images/colorado_springs_0015.jpg) from Colorado Springs. That photo shows a spark gap positioned beneath the tertiary coil. Or it might be some sort of discharge tube. Either would work to liberate photoelectrons from the bare copper wire tertiary coil.

This patent doesn't talk about the possibility, but it might be possible to accomplish this reduction of electron inertial mass with ion acoustic waves inside a cavity resonator or waveguide. A spark gap in a cavity resonator would produce high energy light, energetic particles, radio waves and ion acoustic waves where they could all be harnessed via induction-amplifying low inertial mass electro",Musk

"An [old news article](http://www.rexresearch.com/feg/britten.htm) about this device made some incredible claims.

Inventor Promises Free Light & Power  
*Daily News* (Lansing, Michigan), December 31, 1930

>Electric light and power ?as free as air? is the literal promise of Chancey J. Britten, 73-year old [one year younger than Tesla] electrical wizard of Charlotte, Michigan. He is obtaining patents to safeguard his invention, a device which actually extracts electricity from the air without the aid of customary generators and motors. It consists of an aerial, home-made generator, and storage batteries. Photo shows him in front of his home, which he lighted for two years without expenditure of a penny for maintenance. At right is a closeup of the generator. Britten has defied anyone to explain the inner workings of his plant. 

---

The circuit depicted in Fig. 4 is only showing how the device can be used with a normal 3-battery radio receiver of the era to improve reception. I colorized some lines just to keep it from causing anyone a headache trying to follow the circuit, but the circuit really isn't special or important. A different circuit would presumably be used with the device for atmospheric energy harvesting, namely a wideband receiver circuit, which is a simpler circuit. This normal radio receiver circuit uses three tuned stages of RF amplification to achieve sharp tuning. Those are followed by two stages of audio amplification. A wideband receiver circuit only needs one RF amp stage for active rectification and doesn't need any subsequent amplification. Or it can use a diode or two or four. It's easy to make a wideband receiver with crystal radio by just leaving out tuning components. The ""crystal"" of crystal radio is a Schottky diode. Wideband radios are kind of neat. They let you to listen to hundreds of radio stations and all the radio static over a wide bandwidth simultaneously, which all combined become noise. That noise is what we would hear if we could hear electromagnetism.

Britten makes no effort to explain how the device works in his patent.

>Just how the structure results in the advantages stated is problematical and applicant is only able to state the results and define the structure which accomplishes the same without expanding on the theory by which it is accomplished.

Trying to guess how the device might work, it contains three paths, the central conductor, the coil around it and the external tube. They are all shorted at both binding posts. The coil is depicted as containing multiple layers. The way it's mounted on an insulator base indicates it must be charged to the high voltage of the aerial. HF currents probably can't flow through the external copper tube, so they must flow through the inner two conductors. I can't guess much more about how it might work beyond that. Brown's oscillation intensifier tubes help explain how the device might work.

The three paths might work like a three-terminal capacitor but for cu",Musk
"These patents describe a process for combining HF AC and DC or low frequency AC in order to amplify HF AC using coaxial ""intensifying tubes or conductive sheaths"" that work by algebraic field superposition. They combine the features of capacitors and transformers for the purpose of producing amplification. They can be used with current on both conductors or only on one.

I believe algebraic field superposition is a concept that Tesla described elsewhere, but I'm not able to find the source for that now. Does anyone know what the source is? Of course the description of amplification as ""magnification"" is a terminology quirk that Tesla used elsewhere including most notably in his 1907 magnifying transmitter patent US1119732.

The third patent provides the most explanation. As HF oscillations flow through the existing and continuous field of EM energy, HF oscillations are ""in effect, magnefied, or there is produced an algebraic total of the effects of both."" It includes an explanation of how a charged capacitor can be used as a HF current intensifier or magnifier. 

>The invention proceeds upon the following principles: Whenever an electric current flows along a wire, there is developed a field of electro-magnetic force all around said wire. The electricity of the ordinary continuous or constant electric current does not substantially differ in its kind or nature from an alternating current of electricity, or from an electric current which oscillates very rapidly, and which is termed in wireless telegraphy, ""a high frequency oscillating current."" But said constant current, said low frequency alternating current, and said high frequency oscillating currents are all of the same substantial nature, and, therefore, when electricity of one kind is directed into the field of electricity of another kind, the several kinds of electricity become added together algebraically. By ""algebraically"", I mean, for example, that supposing that the independent constant current is positive in its direction, then the field thereby developed around the aerial will increase the strength of those vibrations of the high frequency oscillations which are in the positive direction, and will decrease the strength of those high frequency oscillations which are in the negative direction, and the effect of said oscillations, in the total, upon detecting instruments will be increased. Therefore, if high frequency oscillations are caused to pass through a field which is produced by constant currents, there will in every case be produced a certain algebraic increase in the strength of said high frequency oscillations, and in the effect said high frequency oscillations will produce upon the detecting instruments. Now, in this present invention I cause a continuous flow of constant current electricity to proceed along a certain part of the aerial wire, which provides the path for the high frequency oscillations, when said high frequency oscillations are produced on the antenna by Hertz",Musk
"I doubt a decent compressed air engine can be 3D printed.

This video seemed to imply Tesla only produced one reciprocating steam/air engine patent, but he produced several. One purpose of his reciprocating engines was to produce sinusoidal high frequency AC for lighting, wireless signaling and wireless power transmission. Another purpose was to produce a clock timing device. Another purpose was apparently to produce a vibrating engine for powering a shaking table for processing mining ores. A shaking table prototype is apparently the device that made Mark Twain suddenly need to use the bathroom in that one story. 

The way that the reciprocating engine worked as an earthquake machine is also very interesting. As Tesla described it, it was designed to operate with so little friction that it could respond to the minute sympathetic vibration of the structure to which it was attached, so it would begin oscillating at a very, very low rate and only speed up as the vibration built up in the attached object.

"Here is an early experiment with converting radioactive decay particles to electric current by resonant current amplification, which is an extremely powerful concept. In the experiment, the radio antenna is a solenoid coil with widely spaced bare wire. Positioning an ampoule containing a very small amount of radium bromide in proximity to the antenna coil increases the amplitude of very feint signals.

The concept is only being used to amplify very weak signals here, but radioactive particle direct energy conversion is a fantastically powerful concept that could replace batteries, fossil fuels, thermal nuclear fission power and every form of renewable energy. 

According to numerous statements he made about the topic over the years, Tesla developed advanced forms of this concept including the ability to harness naturally occurring radioactive matter (NORM) eliminating any need for dangerous toxic radioactive materials like radium.

"A. Frederick Collins was a young New York inventor loosely affiliated with Tesla. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Frederick_Collins

Lee De Forest was a similar inventor loosely affiliated with Tesla. Like other inventors affiliated with Tesla, Collins worked for a couple of  Gustave Gehring's companies like Harry Shoemaker, G. Whittier Pickard and Robert Marriott. He didn't work for what became the main company, International Wireless Telegraph Construction Co., though.

This book explains a lot of theories and devices that provide context explaining terms Tesla used and how he used them. The early history is the best part of this book. It would appear to explain in more detail the points that Tesla often made about Newton, Boscovitch, Faraday, Maxwell and Hertz.

There are a lot of problems with the history presented here too. It ignores all of Tesla's contributions after his early 1892 oil-immersed Tesla coil. It ignores the surface wave method that started with Amos Dolbear. And it gives all credit for inventions between 1890 and 1902 to Marconi and others in the Edison camp like Thomson, Lodge, Fleming, Fessenden, Slaby, De Forest, and Collins himself. This is certainly not the history Tesla would tell of this period of invention. Strangely, after giving Marconi credit for various of Tesla's ideas, it describes some of Tesla's inventions after 1903. 

Collins was imprisoned by the SEC for stock fraud for a year in 1913 for failing to produce a wireless phone system that he sold to a lot of investors. The exact details of this are unclear. According to this book, Collins invented a photophone light-based telephone like Alexander Graham Bell, Ernst Ruhmer and Roberto Landell. Maybe that's what he was selling, but it didn't work over the distances he sold it for. Or maybe he didn't own the rights to whatever system he was selling. It's not clear what system he was selling, so nothing else about it is clear either.

Here's a copy of this book on Google Books if you'd rather read it there or if any diagrams are missing or unreadable in this version. https://books.google.com/books?id=RR4PAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR1

I forgot about this earlier, but before the photophone he mentioned in this book that he apparently never managed to patent, Collins had previously patented a surface wave system in 1900 based on Dolbear's concept.

"These weird light bulbs are tubular rings, cylinders or spirals. They have an incandescent filament like regular incandescent light bulbs, but they don't have an electrical connection to power. Instead they're powered by magnetic induction the same as the secondary coil of a transformer. 

The filament can be part thin wire that is incandescent and part thick wire that doesn't got hot enough to produce light as shown in Figs. 3, 4, 7 and 9. That way only part of the bulb produces light. Then the bulb can be turned on the magnet core to control where the light is directed and how much of the light output is shining away from the light to be visible.

Accessing it with deep internal dissonance, which we all now have, will wreck untold destruction.  It is only when your spirit is congruous and consequently pure that you are meant to find it, else you cannot handle it, like an in built fail safe. This is what the ancients referred to as opening your minds eye, becoming a god or what elon here refers to as the vector. In reality we are a biological quantum computer capable of infinite computational power, able to navigate reality itself with theoretical 100% accuracy (see:noise) and conscuously control all of our organic systems. Every piece of data we sense since the day we're born is stored quantumly in our biology. Tesla was aware and seems to have mastered it, attuning his senses to perfection and having dominion over his entire being. This is the power of instinct. The calculative accuracy depends on noise in the system... needs must tune into and become resonant with the source frequency. I believe only autistic people are meant to access it, but elon will change this with grave consequence. If you're ever faced with the choice I advise to reject neuralink or any form of bionics at all costs.",Musk
"The first FBI archive was released in 2016, the last in 2018. These are not Tesla documents, they are almost all about 3rd party comments and questions about Tesla, as well as some summaries about what was retrieved after his death.  
  
John Trump (Donald Trump's uncle) was selected to review the several trunks of actual Tesla working documents. John Trump's review, after spending a few days to go through all the trunks, was that ""there was nothing of significance and most of the documentation was self-serving marketing"". Nobody else examined the contents of the trunks until they were finally released to the Belgrade Museum. The Belgrade Museum cataloged the contents, and found several notebooks had pages ripped out of them. They also noted there were references to other documents that were not in what the FBI turned over. John Trump went on to file multiple patents regarding x-ray, radar, high voltage phenomena, the acceleration of electrons to high energies, and the interaction of radiation with living and non-living matter.   
  
Even in these released documents, there are multiple pages that are almost totally redacted (blacked out), still classified 70 years after his death. Efforts to get unredacted copies have been unsuccessful, and the FBI is now saying they no longer have the original copies, just more 'lost' Tesla files.

"Here's an unusually artistic device. It's a solenoid-electromagnet push rod speaker/microphone like was popular in the 1920s, but instead of the normal cone, the acoustic diaphragm is a sphere or oblate spheroid. This seems like something Tesla could have invented for its aesthetics because spherical terminals were distinguishing features of his early radio antennas (that later became the more familiar torroid). 

I wonder how well this worked. The text says frequency response is flat from 25-10,000 Hz, so maybe the low frequency response is decent. It might still be a practical design where omnidirectionality matters. 

As a speaker that is also simultaneously a microphone, it might offer an advantage for noise cancellation in open areas. 

This could use Tesla's 1893 electromagnet coil winding to maximize efficiency that I posted about a couple weeks ago. /r/Tesla/comments/c0bt9b/teslas_other_coil_1893_resonant_coilwinding_for/ 

Radio Inventions Inc. was the most amazing company in mechanical television. They patented a lot of brilliant ideas like mechanical television projectors and 3D mechanical televisions. And at least some of it looks a lot like Tesla. For instance, one of their mechanical television receivers uses a carefully balanced spinning spiral neon tube to produce a picture for viewing directly or the brightness can be increased to project the picture on a screen.

"This is the other Tesla coil and coil winding method that time seems to have forgotten about because it was overshadowed by the iconic high voltage Tesla coil. This is essentially the idea of using the distributed capacitance of a coil and especially using distributed capacitance to move current through a coil without normal impedance. Neutralizing impedance increases quality factor, increases the peak magnetic field strength of current, and can be used to widely broaden the bandwidth of resonance (at least with two conductors or with more conductors or sections the resonant bandwidth can be sharper for better filtering). 

The leftmost inventions show preceding ideas where two coils in proximity are wound oppositely. That is kind of similar but it's not the same idea. And before Elihu Thomson patented that as a lightning transient filter, Charles J. Van Depoele patented that slightly different winding for use on a motor in the 1880s. 

Richard Varley patented the idea in Canada for an induction coil in 1892, the year before Tesla patented it in the US, but Tesla once said ""the Varley coil"" was his idea. In fact if I'm remembering correctly, Tesla said Roentgen was using an induction coil he got from Varley when Roentgen discovered x-rays. 

""The Varley coil"" as it's described later is an x-ray transformer a little different from the 1892 patent. Later versions are flat spiral windings all wound the same way but wired inside-to-inside and outside-to-outside between sections. That uses the capacitance between sections differently. 

Charles Buckingham and Emil Germann patented the idea as a band pass filter to prevent sparking on the contacts of a telegraph key. It suggests using multiple parallel or sectional windings for better function, which should reduce sparking by increasing the selectivity of a filter. 

There are more patents that feature this idea in various applications that would appear to be related to Tesla continuing until years after his death. Besides electromagnets, resonators and filters, this idea should be useful for improving the efficiency of rotary motors by reducing impedance and making electromagnets more resonant, but I haven't found a patent on that idea yet. The closest idea I've found so far is an interesting electrostatic/electrostatic-electromagnetic motor patented by a Guatemalan priest in 1899.

"Tesla didn't invent coil windings, that was Oersted that did that. It became standard to wind them as stacked spirals. The flat coil winding that Tesla developed was unlike anything before because it only works with High Voltage High Frequency Alternating Current. Tesla was not the inventor of AC but he most certainly was the inventor of High Voltage High Frequency Alternating Current (HVHFAC).  
  
Tesla claimed he visualized his designs on the back of his head, in a 2-inch square box, completely finished. He completely designed the entire electrical power grid, even to the point of using aluminum wire for the HVHFAC power transmission, down to every component. But, as soon as he was done with that, he basically saw it as obsolete, and developed the wireless transmission of electric power. There is massive historical confusion there. Wardenclyffe was not a Tesla coil, although it had one in it to act as a ""pump"", it was an electric energy harvester, and the power transmission was through the ground. He demonstrated the use of the flat winding resonant coil to the US Patent Office, with a working model. This air transmission of electric power is a different method, but Tesla said it would send large amounts of power around the globe, as easy as he was demonstrating to the patent office.

Seeley, Examiner in Chief, U.S. Patent Office, on the 23rd of January, 1898.  This experiment illustrates a great departure I had made a little prior to that date.  Up to the end of 1896, I had been developing the wireless system along the lines set forth in my lecture which is in the Martin book, particularly in the chapter on Electrical Resonance, pages 340-349.**  As I stated then, if that plan of mine was practicable, distance meant absolutely nothing; distance merely came into consideration when you flashed rays, electro-magnetic or Hertzian waves, or some agency of that kind.  By the plan I had conceived, if it was realizable, it was just as easy to telegraph or telephone across the entire globe as it is across this room.

Tesla went on to decide that Wardenclyffe as an electricity harvester was obsolete, mainly due to findings after Wardenclyffe was foreclosed on. He had been able to do enough testing that he became aware of his Cosmic Rays,  (from the Sun, not the astronomy cosmic rays from stellar collisions), which he described as limitless energy. His estimate was that he could tap into several kilowatts per square meter of a collector plate.

"Al Hubbard was not known to be a protege of Tesla, but he must have been because he invented something Tesla had invented, a nuclear reactor so simple that it doesn't appear to be a nuclear reactor. It was a more advanced form of the same reactor first patented in 1896 by Tesla protege Nathan Stubblefield. 

This type of reactor is so simple that it's not much more than an electromagnet or array of electromagnets. It is a type of breeder reactor that requires only a tiny amount of highly radioactive material. Most of the material it uses is unenriched thorium and uranium crude ore. The small amount of enriched material may be as little as 50-100 mg of radium, enriched uranium, polonium, radon or pretty much any alpha emitter. Radon has the advantage of being an abundant byproduct of nuclear energy production and nuclear waste storage. As a gas it is unwieldy, but it could be used in a permanently sealed ampoule. 

Apparently Stubblefield's patent prevented Hubbard from obtaining a patent for his version of it. The Pittsburgh-based Radium Corporation of America bought the rights to Hubbard's invention and shelved it. That was the fate of all of Tesla's most powerful inventions. 

Tesla mentioned he discovered atomic radiation before anyone else a number of times, but he never tried to take credit for the true extent of his contributions. Tesla was the unsung true father of nuclear physics. 

Atomic radiation can be used to improve radio transmission and reception. Hubbard used his knowledge of radioactive radio to smuggle alcohol during Prohibition. 

In 1950, seven years after Tesla's death, Hubbard entered the next act of his life as ""the Johnny Appleseed of LSD."" He would introduce all the other members of what became the psychedelic movement to Swiss chemist Albert Hoffmann's mind-expanding hallucinogen. 

Somehow Paul M. Brown found out some of the details of Hubbard's device and patented his own version of it in 1986. Brown was also unsuccessful in bringing the product to market, and eventually he was murdered by an activist short seller who had put him out of business who he was going to testify against in court. /r/Tesla/comments/t5c0v5/inductive_nuclear_reactor_for_direct_conversion/",Musk

"I added arrows to highlight the thrusters and a figure showing where I would guess the pilot might sit.

The engine is a reaction engine, but it has pistons. It's not a turbine jet engine like jets we know. Apparently each cylinder is a pulse jet engine with a piston. The only purpose of the piston is controlling the valves. There's no crankshaft or camshaft. The patent doesn't mention the ignition because the engine is not part of this patent. There should be more details about this weird engine if it was ever patented (on its own), but I don't know if it was or by whom. It could be related to George Ennis's 1889 pulse reaction engine patent (US745805).

The explosive thrust from the cylinders are directed through pipes to the thrusters. The pipes carrying pressurized exhaust gases would probably wear out pretty quickly. They didn't have the superalloys needed for jet engines yet in 1909.

I wonder how well this could have worked. The text mentions danger. That sounds like an understatement.

This is like the forgotten predecessor of the Harrier jet.

This could be unrelated but Hugo Gernsback depicted a [conical electrostatic charge collector](http://www.magazineart.org/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=29920&g2_serialNumber=2) in 1924 as part of an unknown wireless power transmission idea that was very likely Tesla's, so it's possible that the conical canopy of this might also have been designed to function as a power receiver in a different version of this invention. 

The airflow in the canopy is like an upside down fountain.

The text of the patent doesn't mention it, but you can see this diagram shows the light shining through a picture silhouette, which is another neat little idea.

"Marconi was an Italian aristocrat youth experimenting with circuits he read about in magazines who eventually came to the British Edison Company looking for funding. Edison created the Marconi Company and American Marconi Company for self-dealing because he was the research director for the US Navy and had a lot of influence in other countries too.

It's kind of weird the US did not produce a similar government scandal even though the same things were occurring here too. 

Edison had a lot of influence with American newspapers maybe just for having a large advertising budget.

At this time, Tesla was apparently working with a number of other inventors including especially John Stone Stone and Fritz Lowenstein among others. John Stone Stone credited Tesla for originating the four-circuit selective signaling concept in his patent on the concept. Despite that, ignorant American courts gave Marconi credit for that invention until shortly after Tesla's death.

This was all a long time before the big radio companies quit trying to compete with each other by forming RCA in 1919. 

The lesson to draw from it all would appear to be that with sufficient backing and investment, corporate criminals are only rewarded for their misdeeds and can maintain a good reputation indefinitely.

I should say, there are also good things to say about the Marconi Company too. For example, they bought patents from Isidor Kitsee. They hired Harry Shoemaker after they ran Tesla's partner Gustave Gehring out of business, and later they hired Roy A. Weagant.

"This kind of pulsed arc fusion research is already yielding promising results with only a tiny fraction of the budget of the big projects that get all the attention and money. Like other smaller projects like this, they are apparently working with only a tiny fraction of the cost of a nuclear power plant.

The proton-boron fusion-fission reaction is clean. The pulsed arc reactor output is an ion beam and x-rays that are directly converted to electric without an intermediate heat cycle and heat engine. That makes it much more efficient, inexpensive and safe. The reactor and converter have no moving parts. As I've said about aneutronic nuclear previously, he mentions one major advantage is the lack of weaponizability unlike normal nuclear energy with uranium or other radioactive fuel.

Direct conversion of particle energy to electric is possible with many dirty nuclear reactions too, but everything becomes contaminated with radiation, which slowly destroys the reactor and converter and turns them into nuclear waste. That's obviously a huge drawback. Clean nuclear reactions like boron fusion avoid those problems allowing the reactor to be used for long periods of time before they should need any maintenance.",Musk

"This is a relatively simple process to capture carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) as sodium carbonate. 

The carbonate this produces can be used for any industrial purposes to offset carbonate from others sources. Or it can be pumped into the ground to become limestone. Underground limestone is harmless and might even be somewhat useful to limit erosion along coasts and peninsulas. 

Among others working on this, some Wisconsin power plants have been developing this technology for the past few years. They said they intend to be ready to implement it widely next year. They are applying it to coal, which makes toxic ash pollution besides the carbon dioxide air pollution, but if it works for coal, it will work for natural gas and oil too.

I would think the costs could come down to around half that pretty easily by improving the efficiency of refrigeration and with economies of scale, but that's just my worthless speculation. 

This kind of carbon capture can be applied to the other major industrial carbon sources like steel and cement manufacturing. 

The process in this patent is not specifically designed to reduce soot and other particulate matter in exhaust gas, but it would also do that because it consists of a wet filtration through the distillation stack. This is a great feature because soot and other fine particulates from fossil fuels have been found to have many terrible health effects. 

Here's a fairly recent academic overview of the chilled ammonia carbon capture process. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610214018815 

I wonder if the chilling could be passive or absorption refrigeration powered by the heat of the exhaust gas to improve energy efficiency. I also wonder if energy could be harvested with an aqueous ammonia heat engine that could also capture carbon with this ammonia-carbamate-carbonate process.

The point remains, carbon capture technology has been around for a long time, around 160 years. It does cost quite a bit now (30% for *coal* means it should only be half that for oil and gas) but that's largely only because it hasn't been improved more yet. If this were something consumers, politicians or businesses had cared about more already, carbon capture could probably be pretty cheap by now. ",Musk
"George Westinghouse, Jr. was a Civil War veteran whose older brother died in that war. Unlike other leading businessmen of his time, he was agreeable.

Where Edison happily used patent trolling to arrest technological progress for personal profit, Westinghouse could appreciate the value in technological progress benefiting us all.

Westinghouse's personal inventions were mostly related to train safety to prevent the deadliest form of traffic accidents of his time and eliminate the need for a dangerous job they said killed 5,000 men in a bad year?and when that was a much larger proportion of the population than it is now.

Westinghouse only owned Westinghouse Electric for 21 years after starting it in 1886. In 1907, when the powerful bankers squeezed the credit markets in another panic, his large debts for global expansion cost him the company. GE and Westinghouse have presumably been owned by the same people since then. Edison lost the War of the Currents after 1893, but Morgan still won control of Westinghouse's company 14 years later.

Westinghouse also invented a corporation but it was a more benevolent corporation, where the workers were more like a family, growing the corporation while the corporation took care of the workers and their families. It never caught on and died out with the passing of Westinghouse.    
  
Anyway, it is too late. What's done is done. We are all living in the Henry Ford - internal combustion engine, Thomas Edison - metered electric utilities and mercenary corporations, J.P.

Here is an invention Tesla would appreciate. The [steam jet ejector/injector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injector) was invented in the 1850s to use steam to pump water for steam engines. This patent uses steam to create a vacuum within a chamber to condense some of the steam into cold water. This invention also uses two water pumps powered by a steam engine. One pump circulates the cold water to the fountains to chill the building. The other pump provides a water supply from the condensing pool or cistern outside to an elevated tank to create a pressurized water supply. This is not necessary where pressurized water is already available. It mentions the steam engine can be very inefficient like rotary steam engines and mentions the [1866 Behren's rotary steam engine](http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/rotaryengines/rotaryeng6.htm#ber) ([US53915](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/53915.pdf)). Everyone would use electric for this part today because it's so much cheaper and more reliable than steam engines.

Fountains could be used for distributing hydronic (water-based) air conditioning with high efficiency with any form of refrigeration. Tesla patented a very quiet fountain in 1913. http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1113716.pdf Fountains generate a low density cloud of slow negative water ions that should help retain cool air within a space as well as making the air feel more refreshing. 

This patent calculates that it achieves 44% efficiency of the thermal energy of fuel combustion (coal), so it costs less to cool a building in the summer than to heat buildings in the winter. It uses low pressure steam like is used for steam heating, so it allows the same boilers be used for air conditioning. Much better results are possible using refrigerant. Refrigerant in heat pipes can be used for passive refrigeration that's much more efficient than this, but that should also be a lot more expensive.

Apparently steam jet refrigeration and air conditioning like this did not start to become popular until the 1930s, so this idea is decades ahead of its time. Today steam jet refrigeration is only used industrially. There don't seem to be any products available for consumers.

Small-scale solar boilers and steam generators generally produce low pressure steam, which is less useful for most mechanical purposes, but it is still useful for this form of cheap low-tech cooling.

"This is an idea that Tesla talked about, using multiple radio channels simultaneously to increase the number of channels available. Prior to the establishment of the predecessor to the FCC, Tesla wrote that using multiple-channel tuning like this would eliminate the need for regulating the radio spectrum to limit consumer use.

>At the present time, there is available for point to point communication systems in the high frequency range the frequency band extending from 1500 to 23,000 kilocycles. Of this frequency range, the band extending from 1500 kilocycles to 6000 kilocycles is known as the continental high frequency band and has been assigned for use in point to point communication over the continent. 

>In the present state of the art, it is generally considered that the separation between the mean frequencies of the individual communication channels in these bands must be 0.2% of the frequency assigned to a particular channel. Thus, a channel having an assigned frequency of 6,000 kilocycles must includes a frequency band of 12 kilocycles. The communication system of the present invention has been developed for use in communication over channels in the continental high frequency band and has proven to be capable of practically operating with a channel separation which is only one-fifth of the channel separations heretofore deemed practicable. However, the invention is not limited to this specific increase of the channel number practicable within the range of frequencies available for commercial use, nor to the particular frequency band, but its features are applicable and useful to improve radio communication systems, to decrease the channel separation necessary for efficient, simple and reliable radio communication between widely spaced points. Through, the use of the invention, it is possible to provide many more communication channels within the available radio spectrum than with the systems known heretofore, each channel being capable of operating without interfering with the adjacent channels and without being disturbed by signals transmitted in these channels. 

>By utilizing the apparatus and arrangements of the invention, I have obtained practical point to point commercial telegraphic communication within the band of frequencies assigned to such channel through five distinct communication subchannels, each subchannel operating in the same way as a normally assigned channel is intended to operate. In practice, it has been found convenient to have these subchannels separated by a frequency band of 750 cycles, although a larger number of subchannels may be provided within the assigned frequency band by following the principles of the invention.

Subchannels use narrower bandwidth and can be spaced closer. Interference between transmissions using one of the same subchannels should be limited to a small fraction of normal, but this does not necessarily allow subchannels to be used simultaneously by different transmissions without any inte",Musk
"Thomas Henry Moray invented nuclear reactor vacuum tubes powered by tiny x-ray tubes embedded within an outer tube that combined the functions of a tiny nuclear reactor and vacuum capacitor.

Moray's new nuclear technology has confused a lot of people over the years because for a long time he used an antenna to generate power by amplifying an ambient noise signal. That lead many to believe that he must be receiving a large amount of radio power somehow. The way that he talked about receiving energy in his book contributed to that misunderstanding.

Instead of receiving a huge amount of radio energy, which is impossible, his device worked by converting mass to particle energy in some nuclear reaction and then converting particle energy into electric charge. The radio noise input might not be anything besides a convenient arbitrary AC signal to amplify. The way that Moray said that it received external power appears to have been related to Tesla's theory that radioactivity is caused by some external radiation disturbing the mass energy in radioactive matter. (edit: And it really only obfuscates the simple way that we can understand how the device worked.)

Moray's patent on his technology shows tube designs that Tesla first displayed in his 1897 lecture about vacuum tubes. The timing of this patent is kind of interesting too. He applied for it only a few months after Tesla died.

In it Moray is somewhat confusing for explaining Tesla's unusual theory of radioactivity, which I don't understand, but the power-generating device makes sense if you look at it as using x-rays to perform nuclear reactions in vacuum tubes and harnessing particle energy directly as electric charge. Direct particle energy conversion makes it a form of new nuclear, and using x-rays to produce radioactivity instead of radioactive isotopes could reduce residual radioactivity greatly, but it's not as clean as boron fusion, which is the newest and best form of new nuclear. Moray's work is incredible as an originator of some of Tesla's nuclear ideas, but now we have an even better, cleaner method. New nuclear is the only way to solve the climate problem and pollution problem and mitigate all the countless harmful effects humans have had on nature. We will destroy nature without some revolutionary energy tech solution like this.",Musk
"This planet Earth does not ""float"" in a ""sea"". That is a white-jesus 'christian' description, calling space ""the waters"", and this planet Earth a ""firmament"" that ""floats on the waters"".  
  
This planet Earth is a tiny grain of sand with a melted flake of iron at its center, with a pinhead of a molten uranium-platinum-gold at the center, the Core. It is bound by gravity to the local star, the Sun. The Sun, like all stars, is a Natural Radioactive Fusion Reactor, converting a finite volume of fuel into energy.    
  
People were stealing from Tesla his whole life, as much as they could get away with, and why he had to get a vault to know where his latest work was and secret ways to leave and return to the hotel.  
  
The problem with fixating on the Wardenclyffe time is to ignore the rest of what was happening from there, into World War II. The Whitewashing Revisionism backed by the Edison Institute to wipe Tesla from US history would have the sap/suckers believe he died forgotten and alone, a decrepit old man, in a dank hotel room, considered mostly a babbling mad man that had once been a decent electrician.  
  
Tesla was keeping up with tubes and he invented most aspects of electric potential in vacuum tubes. He is looking at his button lamp in eternal awe, in the 1880's.  
  
It is possible Moray was able to steal some parts of what Tesla was developing in the 1930's.  
  
In 1931, Tesla was on the cover of Time magazine. He also made many announcements that year. It is also in 1931 that the anecdote of Tesla having a Pierce-Arrow in a garage in Buffalo comes from. Apparently, the engine had been pulled out and an AC motor was in its place, then there was a controller/power box that provided the power to the motor. Tesla had two antennas, that he kept in his pocket, and once those were screwed into place, the box started providing kilowatts of power.  
  
1931 was a huge year for Tesla, although the incredibly sinister and evil Edison Institute appears to have been successful programming the street level to zombie-parrot ""Tesla was a lonely old forgotten dirty European immigrant in a dark hovel of a hotel room"". They are also trying to say the Tesla electric car story is a hoax. Yet, 1931 was the year Tesla was making major announcements about a new source of power, meaning not referring to the electricity harvesting method at Wardenclyffe.

"This brilliant simple little nuclear reactor consumes clean non-radioactive fuel, boron-11. B-11 is the most common isotope of boron, which is a very cheap common substance. I'm not sure how expensive it is to purify, but it shouldn't cost much. It must compare very favorably to the expensive highly refined heavy radioactive metals used in thermal fission reactors.

This non-thermal reactor achieves a combined fusion-fission reaction splitting the boron into three alpha particles. Because no neutrons are produced, there should not be any persistent radioactive contamination even inside the reactor-magnetron. The neutrons in normal reactors are what make them so contaminated and contaminating. Neutrons transmute every atom they touch into a radioactive atom, and they are a very penetrating form of radiation.

The reactor is positioned in the center of a magnetron. The reactor works by accelerating protons from the center electrodes to strike a boron target. The energetic particles produced by the boron fusion-fission are harvested resonantly in the surrounding magnetron.

Using resonance to harvest particle energy is the key concept in all direct energy conversion nuclear reactors. Direct conversion nuclear reactors don't use heat to harness the power of the reactor. Radioactive particle energy is directly converted to electric current. Nuclear batteries are a similar simpler idea that harness particle energy directly too, but nuclear batteries convert particle energy to charge instead of using resonance to harness particle energy as current, so they are not very useful. 

It is not necessary to use a cavity resonator like a magnetron to harness particle energy. A cavity resonator can have the advantage of containing all the particles, but it might not be possible to use a cavity resonator with fuels other than boron because they could leak neutrons, gamma rays or other dangerous contaminating radiation.

The late inventor Paul M. Brown developed resonant particle energy harvesting power-generating devices along the same lines as this from the 1980s until his untimely death in 2002. His ideas were more primitive. He used more conventional heavy radioactive substances that produced neutrons. He could use low grade ores instead of requiring purified nuclear fuel because direct energy conversion is so much more efficient than thermal power conversion, but his tech was certainly much dirtier. 

Tesla appears to have developed direct conversion nuclear technology and methods to produce nuclear fuels like radium. He mentioned a process he invented to manufacture radium, and Tesla's associate Hugo Gernsback editorialized that radium would be the ideal fuel of the future. Tesla appears to have worked with the Philadelphia inventor Ernest Linder among others to develop direct conversion nuclear power. Over the years, some other inventors may have invented direct conversion technologies too.

How is the proton accelerated? The CERN Large Hadron Collider is specifically built to accelerate a single proton to relativistic near light speed.

To return the topic to Tesla, he stated the idea of matter colliding being a source of energy was ridiculous and preposterous. Tesla stated he had collided protons many times and hadn't observed any energy that wasn't a product of the energy imparted to the proton. At CERN, a proton and anti-proton are collided together at relativistic speed and they are not observing any huge production of energy. Yes, the internal quanta of the proton are ejected but there is a minimal release of electric, thermal and shock energy.  
  Just being able to accelerate a proton to near relativistic speed, without having to used miles long cryogenic cooled coils would be of infinite value in itself.",Musk

"The way that Tesla replicated certain actions in a way people called obsessive might be more interesting than it seems. Repeating events in time and space is behaving like a time crystal. I don't see what purpose it could possibly serve, but I think that's an interesting comparison. Maybe it's the same reason dogs usually walk in a circle several times before lying down.

Tesla was really upset with Edison and some other prominent American businessmen around 1910-1920, which was when Edison's corporate pirate boy Marconi was receiving credit from the courts and scientific establishment for Tesla's radio ideas, but Tesla had been getting along with Edison pretty well until then. He had never publicly said anything negative about Edison until that time.

When Tesla said he invented more than 700 devices, that was as close as he came to saying publicly that he invented hundreds of things that other inventors patented. It's possible to try to track down all of the inventions that Tesla talked about but did not patent himself. I have been doing this for a while. One example is Rudolph Hunter who appears to have patented Tesla's searchlights that he demonstrated at the Chicago World's Fair that they mentioned in this podcast. Tesla may have been involved with Hunter's electric trains too. Some other more prominent inventors who were at least occasionally working with Tesla's ideas include Fritz Lowenstein, Thomas B. Kinraide, Melvin Severy, Richard Varley, Elmer Sperry, James Buckner Speed, Harry Shoemaker, Cornelius D. Ehret, Reginald Fessenden, Peter Cooper Hewitt, John Stone Stone, G.W. Pickard, Lee De Forest, Frank Conrad, Ernst Alexanderson, Alexander McLean Nicolson, Wendell L. Carlson, Ralph K. Potter, John Hays Hammond, Jr., Laurens Hammond, Ernest G. Linder and Robert Van De Graaff. It's more difficult to talk about how much Tesla accomplished because he gave away credit for so much of what he did. 

This is just my speculation, but I would guess Tesla didn't sleep enough because he breathed too much ozone. Ozone is a powerful stimulant, much stronger than caffeine. Ozone can prevent sleep as strongly as the most powerful stimulant drugs. I've never heard of anyone abusing ozone though, so I have to assume the drugs must be more enjoyable, but ozone is not entirely unenjoyable either. Honestly I've never enjoyed stimulants though, so maybe I'm biased. An *extremely* minuscule amount of ozone produces an initially pleasant energized state, but I doubt it can last very long and still feel pleasant, and I know that with only slightly more ozone, it becomes extremely unpleasant and produces anxiety and would eventually produce death. Part of Tesla's exposure to ozone would have been incidental from all the electric sparks from his research, but he might have also been breathing it intentionally experimenting with using it to prevent respiratory infections. Because even the smallest amounts probably can cause negative health effects, I can only rec",Musk
"This patent describes simple apparatus that consists of a Tesla lightning protector positioned over a spark gap that is used to collect atmospheric energy. A Tesla lightning protector is an ultra high voltage terminal. The spark discharge is used as an antenna to collect both atmospheric charge and ambient thermal energy. The author says the electric thermal energy of the atmosphere is much greater than the energy of atmospheric electric charge. 

Among other inventors Hermann Plauson and Ewald Rasch patented similar concepts in 1920. Rasch used an arc discharge from a kite: [GB179967](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/010335657/publication/GB179967A?q=pn%3DGB179967A). Plauson used radioactive metal balloons flying over spark gaps hanging beneath the balloons and also at ground level: [US1540998](https://www.google.com/patent/US1540998). Apparently they also explained this same electric thermal energy concept, but their explanations were not as clear. Serafino Orlando explained the thermal energy more clearly in 1924: [GB231247](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/009699504/publication/GB231247A?q=pn%3DGB231247A). 

This patent explains the conventional Wilson thunderstorm theory of atmospheric charge (1920) is wrong. It says the thermal electric energy of the atmosphere is the real cause of atmospheric charge. 

It draws this thermal electric energy from the atmosphere by imitating the process of thunderstorms. It uses ultra high voltage (> 1 MV). 

""By copying processes that we see in a thunderstorm, we can create an active antenna that extracts charge and energy from the atmosphere. For this we use an electrical discharge of a suitable high voltage between two specially designed electrodes. The electrons lose their temperature (chaotic movement) in this discharge, which causes a supply of energy to start from the environment, and furthermore, the pressure to the outside falls away. This energy supply ionizes air in the vicinity of the discharge and increases the voltage of the charge present. The electric and magnetic fields generated by the discharge concentrate the charge on the receiving electrode.""

Claims (2):  

1. An antenna that actively attracts atmospheric charge characterized by: a) two electrodes, one of which has a much greater self-capacity than the other; b) that the smaller electrode is supplied with suitable high-frequency high voltage, whereby a discharge takes place to the larger electrode; c) that the electrons in that discharge lose much of their temperature and thereby attract energy from the environment; d) that the energy attracted ionizes atoms in the vicinity of the discharge; e) that the discharge attracts charge from its environment, inter alia by means of the pinch effect; f) that on the larger electrode the charge of the smaller electrode plus the attracted atmospheric charge and energy becomes available.

"It is just a plain, simple fact that this planet, Earth, has a gigantic electrostatic field, that increases to thousands and thousands of volts, the higher the altitude. The problem with street-level popular history is that it has to take significant discovery events and trivialize them, making them more prurient for layman consumption. This is what happened with Benjamin Franklin and his kite in a lightning storm, using a silk string as the electrostatic conductor. It wasn't the fact there was lightning that was significant. It was that Franklin discovered he could acquire thousands of volts with his kite, and that would conduct to the key he had as the collector. What history didn't note is that was in 1752. The Leyden jar was invented in 1745. Franklin found he could charge banks of Leydon jars (capacitors) with his simple kite and key collector. Franklin goes to France in 1774, to lobby for French support against the British, and promptly forgets what he is doing, spending most of his time with French royalty and their almost daily partying, and orgies. One of the novelties he introduced was getting a shock from a Leyden jar as a therapeutic and titillating jolt.  
  
The factors to note, one, is the Leyden jar is a capacitor with a solid dielectric.  
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8303875  
  
Realize, we are entering a time where solid dielectric supercapacitors are being talked about that charge in 15 minutes to drive a 60kW electric car for a 500 mile range.   
  
The other is the Earth's electrostatic field is produced by gigantic electrical currents under the crust. Tesla saw both of these and knew exactly how to harvest the Earth's static electric field and tap into the dynamo currents. However, due to the scale, required massive ""pumps"" to tap into the ""wells"".  
  
He also was aware of the consequences, and anybody that knows that period of history, was going along with the established concept of drawing energy out of the Earth (cutting down trees, pumping oil, burning whale oil, digging coal out of the ground, etc.).  
  
Tesla was very aware of Radiant Energy, the energy that was bathing the Earth. He did debate with himself if solar panels wouldn't be better (over 50 years before the invention of the transistor which led to solar cells).

"This is the best biography of Tesla's youth I've ever read. It provides considerable detail about events in Tesla's early life that he mentioned in his autobiography. It reads like an addendum to Tesla's autobiography that fills in the details. 

For instance it explains why as a child he became determined to become a genius before he knew what the word meant and pushed himself so forcefully to that goal. It says what he was doing when he got trapped in the abandoned church and how he was rescued. It says Tesla was so mad at Edison for lying about the promised bonus of $50,000 that he didn't tell anyone he quit. He just walked out without saying anything to anyone and never came back.

Unfortunately the author seems to lose track of everything Tesla did after around 1894-1900. It's clearly wrong about many things after the period it covers well. For instance it says Tesla and JP Morgan were good friends throughout their lives and that Morgan gave Tesla the money for Wardenclyffe without any conditions, but we know that's not true. Tesla sold Morgan the controlling stake in his wireless tech for the $150k he got for Wardenclyffe, which was only half the cost of constructing it. And then Morgan refused to sell it back to Tesla when Tesla subsequently wanted to work with other investors who actually wanted to see it work. Morgan wanted Wardenclyffe to fail and made that happen. We have Tesla's telegrams now, so we can read his messages to Morgan begging him to sell it back to him, and we know that Morgan ignored him. 

Tesla's greatest mistake was betting on Morgan not being an evil, greedy, misanthropic bastard. He lost that bet, because of course he did. Morgan was a very different kind of tragic figure. His father had intentionally trained him to hate his fellow man from a young age. Plus he contracted syphilis from a prostitute as a young man and had to live with his nose rotting off for the rest of his life. To be fair, I'm sure that would make me hate people too.",Musk

"It's neat they're revisiting Tesla's early tower work from before 1910. I wonder if they're using the low frequencies Tesla talked about like the 4-12 kHz range he mentioned in patents. 

This isn't just a power transmission method, using these methods, it's supposed to be possible to harness radio energy from space. Walter Pennock shows what looks like Tesla's influence in using tethered balloons to harvest energy from around 1910. And Hermann Plauson shows what Tesla was encouraging others to do a decade later. He talked about receiving energy with coils 40 to 100 m diameter, and especially with coils over 1 km. He said you could use towers or more economically tethered balloons preferably at very high altitudes like 3 to 30 km. For collecting power, multiple towers or balloons would be connected. That would impede air traffic even more than giant wind turbines do, which would be a problem, but today we could use satellites without the problem with air traffic. Satellites would be even better positioned to harness radio energy from space. 

Besides transmitting power by surface waves or beams, wireless power satellites could reduce ground level cosmic rays and reinforce earth's weakening magnetic field. The weakening field might play a large yet unrecognized role in accelerating climate change. An appropriately designed long range wireless power transmission and space energy harvesting system could be a solution. ",Musk

"Tesla first showed spherical aerial terminals in patents in 1897 (US645576 and US649621), and he was using a spherical aerial at Colorado Springs in 1899, which shows that spherical aerials were originally his idea. 

Spherical aerials don't make sense from a conventional Hertz wave standpoint. This is because they are designed for ground surface wave signaling rather than radiating Hertz waves. For Hertz wave wireless, they don't make as much sense as the more common wire antennas that most other inventors used. With ground surface wave signaling, the aerial isn't an antenna. Instead it is a capacitive waveguide probe that launches surface waves that are bound to the surface(s) of the waveguide. 

Tesla had a complicated relationship with Reginald Fessenden. Like Marconi, Fessenden worked for Edison. And apparently also like Marconi, Fessenden was taking ideas from Tesla without permission. Fessenden once played a sneaky trick on Tesla. He sent a lawyer to Tesla to offer to represent Tesla in a lawsuit that Tesla was not yet even aware had been filed against him (by a third party over an invention), but that lawyer was secretly collecting information from Tesla in order to represent Fessenden to try to claim credit for certain inventions from Tesla. This information only became available from some of Tesla's telegrams that were not released until the past decade. 

Tesla seems to have had a complicated relationship with Isidor Kitsee too. Kitsee was a superhumanly prolific inventor who obtained 299 US patents between 1899 and 1920 slowing down to 9 more between 1920 and 1930. For comparison, Tesla only obtained around 111 US patents for himself. Kitsee lived in Philadelphia, where Tesla worked with a lot of other inventors. He may have like the name of the city for reminding him of his late brother. Kitsee patented a lot of ideas that appear to have been Tesla's, and unfortunately for Tesla, he sold a number of patents to Marconi. Among other things, he also patented some versions of Tesla's electrostatic relay. He also patented a sensitive electromagnetic relay that was apparently Tesla's idea. Kitsee worked with Tesla-affiliated Philadelphia patent attorney Cornelius D. Ehret on some of his patents. There's a lot more to be said about Kitsee's many Tesla-related patents. I will probably post more of them later. 

Presumably more amicably Daniel Watts Troy's patents show he was obviously working with Tesla. He patented many of Tesla's simpler ground surface wave power transmission ideas. He was apparently the only inventor besides Tesla who talked about transmitting enough power to operate devices rather than transmitting only signals. I posted one of Troy's wireless power transmission patents last month. /r/Tesla/comments/9e1a0o/guided_wave_energy_transmission_1904_daniel_watts/

"The two ideas discussed in this article are (1) a floating underwater funnel (Salter sink) to harness power from waves to cool surface water and (2) aerosol injection to brighten clouds. These are both the ideas of Stephen Salter. It's hoped they might prevent hurricanes from forming or at least from intensifying as much. It says that neither has ever been attempted, but Salter's hopes are higher for the second method.

The article also mentions the ill-fated attempt in 1947 to dissipate Hurricane King with cloud seeding. That sounds completely backwards, because cloud seeding should be expected to intensify a storm rather than dissipate it. As expected, it was a miserable failure. Not only did the attempt intensify the storm, but it shifted its direction back toward land where it caused a lot of damage. Irving Langmuir's career consisted of taking credit for either fleshing out or more often butchering ideas that were previously Tesla's, but that dumb idea was almost certainly something Langmuir came up with on his own.

Speaking of counterproductive ideas, I'm won't explain it ever again, but if anyone was interested in that passive resonator concept I mentioned last month, please [message me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=dalkon&subject=important_info) for some additional information because certain details I neglected to mention are incredibly important. (Or if you don't want to message me, please at least be aware that it is likely counterproductive when a storm is a great distance west of the resonator. And from that direction, it tends to direct storms over the resonator. Unfortunately it will not begin to attenuate the storm until it's within about a hundred miles (150 km). That is the most important info I neglected to mention, but please do message me because there's much more.)

Here is another idea for reducing hurricane intensity that is much tamer. High voltage fields and field emission leak copious stray ions into the air that contribute to storms much more than anyone seems to have noticed yet. The power grid produces more than any other man-made source. Because these ions contribute to storm intensity, it should be possible to reduce the intensity of a hurricane simply by shutting off the power before it is expected to reach land.

This requires very little effort, but it couldn't be a popular idea with residents in the area. As inconvenient as turning the power off might seem, it's worth remembering hurricanes disable the power anyway, so voluntarily shutting it off shouldn't be considered too bothersome. Even if this failed to reduce storm intensity, it would still save power companies large sums on replacement transformers, which is a cost factored into the electric price for everyone served by that power company. It would also make it much easier to restore power quickly after the storm passes. Knowing the power would be turned off at a particular time might also encourage people to evacuate safely ahead of time.",Musk
"Pretty good video, including trying to 3D print your own bearings. Tesla's charged particle beam weapon used a Tesla turbine to circulate water. In his drawing that he was sending to various governments in 1937, the Tesla turbine is Item 5.

He was driving the turbine with an electric motor. The water circulated would create a huge charge to be collected on the plate at the top of the tower. This was using a Tesla turbine that he spent 10 years developing after Wardenclyffe, during his employment with Allis-Chalmers. Using laminar flow as a charge generator is a very interesting concept.",Musk
"Hmm? Are you exhausting from around the axis of the rotor or from the other input port? The unused input port is only for reversing rotation. Whichever port is unused should be closed instead of being an output port. The air flow of a Tesla turbine is centripetal to the center of the disks, so this looks almost identical to a Tesla turbine, but it's operating very differently. 

One of the neat things about the centripetal flow design is that efficiency increases with rotor speed because the increasing centrifugal force increases resistance to the centripetal flow.

"This is a pretty simple little concept and sub-component wave responsive device like a coherer. It's an electrometer with hinged plates that move with low inertia. Tesla used it as an electrostatic sensor-switch. Shoemaker used it as a sensor to convert surface waves signals to audio signals. In the terms of the day, this wave responsive device would be called *self-restoring* because unlike a coherer, it doesn't need a decoherer to kick it off again after being switched on.

In later patents, Shoemaker continued to develop this concept into a selective frequency responsive electromagnetically adjustable vibrating switch.

Perhaps more notably, Shoemaker was one of a number of inventors who was also using the ground surface wave model Tesla used, which probably does more to suggest Tesla was working with Shoemaker in some capacity. Shoemaker's patent describes ground surface waves like this, ""The nature of the energy transmitted is principally electrostatic, though there may be some slight component of electromagnetic.""

"The diagrams aren't much to look at, but this is still pretty amazing for providing additional explanation about how Tesla's ground surface wave wireless power transmission concept worked and how it was developed from Amos Dolbear's prior work. Tesla was clearly the author of this patent.

This patent doesn't talk about transmitting industrial power levels, transmitting very long distances, or the possibility of forming standing waves by using resonant frequencies, so this would appear to be a shorter range much lower power level concept than Tesla was building Wardenclyffe for.

Here is the form of plasma globe that Tesla introduced in 1892 performing a function. I annotated the schematic to help see what's going on, and I shifted it around a little bit for legibility because there are too many overlapping lines in the patent. I put a lithograph of Tesla's sensitive rotating brush discharge bulb on the right for comparison.

http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1010669.pdf  

Tesla first described his sensitive rotating brush bulbs in his [1892 Royal Society lecture](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1892-02-03.htm). And he was still talking about them almost 30 years later, but by then he was also talking about using them as [television projectors](http://anengineersaspect.blogspot.com/2013/11/tesla-bulbs.html). Philo Farnsworth used the name *oscillight* for a television projector tube like that when he patented one in 1933. That might have been Tesla's term.

Moore applied for this patent the year before De Forest applied to patent the thermionic vacuum triode. Tesla was still saying his sensitive brush bulb made a better detector (diode) than the vacuum thermionic triode in 1919 after the triode had been improved a lot and had become ubiquitous. Apparently the thermionic triode detector was Tesla's idea too. He said [this lithograph from one of his lectures](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/s40c423127565d23a/image/icb7f1fbc56f3309d/version/1397301945/image.png) was the first diode-amplifier tube. He seems to have given away the thermionic triode concept. Maybe he thought the superior vacuum-plasma bulb would win the technology competition like his AC motors and transmission had defeated inferior DC transmission, but instead his vacuum-plasma bulb was apparently never developed to a retail product.

Tesla's tube was different from contemporary plasma ball/globe because his had an inner plasma globe inside of an outer envelope containing relatively hard vacuum. The hardness of the vacuum needed to be regulated for the bulb to work indefinitely because the discharge in the vacuum envelope would over-harden the vacuum. Contemporary plasma globes have a simpler design with a wire running up the stem to the central carbon coated terminal. Contemporary plasma globes might be somewhat similar to the sensitive brush bulb, but the sensitive brush could be limited to a single discharge stream and it could apparently be made straight.

This patent shows the biggest complication with using the bulbs for very long periods of time as radio detectors was that the vacuum would become too hard over time as the gas was lost to being bom",Musk
"This is a concentric conductor diode tube or ""valve"" in the old parlance. It is only a rarefied gas tube, which is considerably easier to construct than a vacuum tube. 

Its operation is simple too. The central corona wire cathode is charged to -1 kV to adsorb radon to it, which initiates the reactions that produce positive current on the anode. It might generate energy of any arbitrary waveform by amplifying whatever signal is provided to it. It's probably noisy. 

The fusion in the name refers to the fusion-fission by alpha bombardment of the cathode material(s). The fusion cathode wire is made of some appropriate fusible material such as germanium, silicon, lead (II) sulfide, or silver. 

The high work function electron-collecting cylinder is preferably made out of palladium because this metal can absorb a large volume of gas. 

>After a period of time, the alpha particles lose their charge, become helium gas, build up, and the present invention eventually becomes electrically blocked. This is because helium gas is electrically non-conductive. A high work function material that has the ability to absorb gas will delay this process. Other alternative electrical collector materials, such as activated carbon, which has the ability to absorb large volumes of gas, may be used and this will not depart from the spirit of the invention.  

A tube like this can be used in a circuit that resembles a radio receiver. The atmospheric potential gradient is used to initialize the tube. This is how Thomas Henry Moray's radio energy harvesting worked. It didn't really derive power from radio waves. All the power output was generated by nuclear reactions in tubes like this. 

---

Silver alloyed with germanium is commonly available as an anti-tarnish silver for jewelry. The brand name is Argentium. The germanium is concentrated on the surface of the wire as an oxide that protects the silver and copper from oxidizing. It might make an ideal cathode material. 

The device shown is a diode, but a triode arrangement might produce greater output. The cylinder could become a grid-element coil or wire mesh to allow especially electrons to pass thru to a third electrode that could act as the anode. 

The patent doesn't say anything about it, but based on concepts from atmospheric energy harvesting, the tube might want a little magnetic field stimulation to bring the power output up. This would increase the power output by making the particles from the cathode fusion-fission strike the anode at an angle to produce greater ionization, which increases the current output. 

Perreault invented this tube based on concepts he borrowed from Thomas Henry Moray's atomic power tubes. Perreault got his hands on some of Moray's original tubes. He said they were not radioactive when he got them, but they became intensely radioactive after he powered them. In one of his presentations (recently available on youtube) he said he thinks they produce polonium-210 internally. Polonium has ",Musk

"This uses a refrigerant with a low boiling point like ammonia (-33 øC) or sulfur dioxide (-10 øC) that boils at a lower temperature than ambient. To help get power out of the refrigerant gas, means are provided to chill the gas to condense it to liquid. The patent uses passive evaporative cooling on the outer surface of the condenser.

Unfortunately the patent doesn't provide example figures of available power. But even if there weren't much power available in the process, free refrigeration and air conditioning are highly desirable. The condensed working fluid could be used in refrigeration including refrigerators, freezers and air conditioning before being returned to the boiler. The ""boiler"" is really just a heatsink exposed to ambient temperature. This is very similar to a heat pipe passive heat pump, but with the addition of deriving mechanical energy from the working fluid.

Of course solar heat collectors would increase the output power, but then it would be solar power instead of ambient heat power. And it would be solar power that could still produce some power without sunlight just not as much. An ambient heat engine would be a good way of harnessing solar thermal power.

The power produced is derived by some sort of turbine that isn't described in any detail in the patent. For an idea of what sort of turbine could have been intended, here are some other patents from the time.

All these inventions look like Tesla could have originally conceived them. The capacitor in the Pennock patent also appears in some of Harry Shoemaker's radio patents suggesting some connection between the three inventors. And Hermann Plauson used the same zinc amalgam Tesla had used 20 years prior. Plauson wrote a book about atmospheric energy harvesting in German in 1920, which is apparently the most complete account about it. Plauson's patent contemplates a special balloon terminal incorporating a spark gap and high power inductor floating high in the atmosphere (300-3,000 m) to collect the charge of earth's positive potential gradient. Except Jules Guillot, all these plans involved tethered/captive balloons. Carbon fiber like in modern electrostatic charge dissipation array systems that are designed to prevent lightning from striking antennas might work for this. Jules Guillot patented a system using ground-based charge collectors.

Besides this forgotten fantastic technology, Tesla appears to have played some role in developing conventional concentrating solar thermal power too. He was reportedly working with concentrating solar thermal power apparatus in the 1890s. We don't use concentrating solar thermal power much yet either even though it's always been cheaper than photovoltaic solar power.

It has taken over 100 years to find out Wardenclyffe wasn't a Tesla coil, and was not for transmitting power through air. The power was coming out of the air and being transmitted deep underground. It would be similar to burying a Tesla coil upside down into the ground. The legs on the Wardenclyffe tower had solid copper bars in them that were imbedded in giant granite blocks at the base. Granite is an excellent insulator.  

The ""death ray"", which Tesla hated, and called a charged particle beam weapon also has nothing to do with a Tesla coil other than being for the individual microwave beam barrels. A Tesla turbine was being used to produce gigantic electrostatic voltages.

"Here's an interesting early atmospheric energy harvesting patent. It's a tethered balloon that's really one balloon inside another. It has a hydrogen balloon in the center of a hot air balloon. It has a light wire net (3) over the balloon. The net may be barbed with needle points facing out. And it has a second wire net (8) that can also have sharpened barbs pointed out that goes on as an outer layer. The first net layer goes on over the balloon inside the wings and the second layer goes around the outside of the wings. 

The balloon has two concentric rings around it (4, 7). The diagram doesn't make it very clear, but they're big hoops around it all. These rings provide the structural support for the small wings. The wings are lightly weighted and pivot to change their angle so as to make the balloon rotate the same direction on ascending as on descending. It's not clear how much that really helps it collect energy. That feature might not be important. Fixed wings might work as well. Also it's depicted with relatively small wings, but larger wings might be better. 

A hot air balloon is a particularly attractive option for an atmospheric charge collector because it can easily carry a tether to 100-300 m, which is the goal for atmospheric energy harvesting, and it's considerably safer than a hydrogen balloon. The advantage of hydrogen is that it produces lift without consuming energy.

The patent includes a brief hygroelectric theory of atmospheric electric that is wrong. Hermann Plauson noted this in his book. Scientists didn't know where atmospheric charge might come from yet then. That doesn't have any bearing on its design and performance as a charge collector. 

There's not much to say about the circuits. The transformer in Fig. 2 is just to reduce the voltage when the power output from the collector(s) is very high. 

The rheostatic machine is a mechanical voltage multiplier/divider. It's being used as a voltage dividing current multiplier here. 

The electrometer-relay in this is an unusual component that Tesla used in some of his patents including his 1901 radiant energy patent. Tesla only depicted it in a circuit diagram, so it's nice to see what one of these looks like. That voltage-controlled relay switches the battery on to power the motor of the voltage divider when the potential indicates the capacitors are charged. 

We would do this conversion much more easily, efficiently and reliably today. It is neat to see how it could be done mechanically. 

---

Regardless of the design of this particular hot air balloon, hot air balloons do seem like particularly good options for atmospheric charge collectors because they have the lifting force to carry a wire tether and a collector up to 100-1000 m, which is the goal for atmospheric energy harvesting. A hot air balloon is smaller for the lift and safer than a hydrogen balloon. The advantage of hydrogen is that it doesn't use energy to lift; the disadvantage is danger.

Unfortunately much less is known about those later inventions though, so it would be difficult.

Because a movie about his later period is still waiting for someone to write a book about it let alone a screenplay, a book or movie about the group of inventors affiliated with him who were known as ""the Philadelphia crowd"" might be interesting: Harry Shoemaker, Gustav Gehring, Cornelius Ehret, et al.

"The History Channel has a new Tesla series focused on trying to find the Lost Trunks. Tesla had laboratories all over New York, which he was eventually kicked out of for not paying the rent. In the 1930's, he ended up at the Hotel New Yorker where he also had laboratories on a few floors.  
  
Since Tesla was robbed from continuously after Wardenclyffe, he became much more secretive about what he was working on. In a later interview, he mentioned he had 80 large steamer trunks with his research papers. After his death, 50 were found and turned over to the Belgrade museum. That left the question of where the lost trunks went and what was in them. That is what the new series is focused on. They are finding out many things about the New Yorker. It is the same height as the Wardenclyffe tower and had mysterious changes made to its architecture not long before Tesla moved in.

A good follow-on docudrama of Tesla after Wardenclyffe is needed. This was when he was blackballed (ban-hammered) by the Ivory Tower of Physics, which was split even then, between the Relativists and the Quantum Mechanics.  
  
This is why it is so important to know that J.J. Thomson stole the discovery of the electron and the quantum from Nikola Tesla in the late 1800's.  The physics of today are derived from J.J. Thomson's interpretation rather than Tesla's. Einstein was fully aware of Tesla's work and kept stealing from it through out the 1920's. There is still massive confusion in modern physics with what Einstein published, then amended, with the Ivory Tower of Physics embracing the General Theory of Relativity, but rejecting Einstein's own lecture in 1920 regarding the Ether and Relativity.

Tesla's wireless inventions used Dolbear's model rather than Hertz's. Harry Shoemaker, Cornelius Ehret and Nathan Stubblefield were a few of the other inventors working on the same ground surface wave model. The term ""electro-radiant waves"" was coined to encompass both radio waves and ground surface waves. The term was probably Tesla's, but he doesn't seem to have ever used it himself at least in print. Electro-radiant devices were designed to use either method, radio or ground surface wave. Surface waves can be made much more powerful than radio waves. As the 1899-1901 yacht races showed, Marconi and Lee De Forest were unable to transmit messages while Tesla-Shoemaker surface wave radios were in operation. The New York Herald misreported on these events to support Marconi, and for some reason their falsified report is the only one cited on Shoemaker's Wikipedia page.

German-American mining magnate Gustav Gehring bought Dolbear's patent and employed Shoemaker and other inventors. While Shoemaker and Ehret appear to have been patenting Tesla's ideas, Tesla never denounced them for it, which suggests they got Tesla's ideas with his permission. This chapter in early radio history is mostly forgotten in large part because by 1907, journalists friendly with Edison/Marconi had begun calling Gehring and company frauds in what proved to be a very successful publicity campaign to make Marconi look like he invented radio. All Marconi really did was copy Hertz with his initial two-circuit patent and then he copied Tesla with his four-circuit patent.

Marconi and Shoemaker played wunderkinds of the two camps controlled by competing rich old businessmen, Edison vs. Gehring. This aspect of early radio history is apparently mostly forgotten because it makes Edison look underhanded, and the scientific community erred in supporting Hertz, Marconi and Edison over Dolbear, Tesla and Gehring. By using publicity to undermine support for Gehring's companies, the Marconi company was able to purchase Gehring's patents to prevent a legal patent dispute to determine the truth. It seems strange that the scientific community has continued to remain ignorant of the true history of early radio invention to the present day. It goes to show how easily publicity can triumph over science.

"This is probably the most accurate movie documentary made about the span of Nikola Tesla's life, starting out with his final interview. Tesla did fall in love at first sight, but Kathryn Johnson was already married. They stayed friends most of his life and she was the one that got him started, after his fight with Edison for repairing the generator system on the USS Oregon. Most of it is from the O'Neill book, Prodigal Genius and ends with Wardenclyffe, skipping to his last interview at the end, with him saying, ""All this has been unnecessary...unneccesary..."", with World War II in progress.",Musk
"In 1901, the ""universe"" was the known Solar System, Neptune only recently discovered and Pluto not until the 1930's. The idea of planets around other stars was thought to be outlandish in the science community until the 1940's.  
  
This is interesting considering, in 2018, over 3,000 exoplanets have now been found, several imaged directly. These have been mostly gas giants but the era of finding thousands of small, rocky inner exoplanets is only just starting.  
  
Tesla did go into showman mode during these interviews, so his terminology needs to be understood. He was talking about detecting signals from more than 20 planets, meaning exoplanets. He never claimed to have had two-way communication, he only detected what he thought were communications between these exoplanets. It could be that he was detecting pulsars and not knowing what they were, thought they were communications between star systems.    
  
These are a few areas out of his Colorado Spring testing results that don't get covered because they have been too fringe, until now. He was talking about frequencies up to 10^24 cycles per second. Gamma ray telescopes, which had a Top Secret reason in the 1970's for happening, are now used to monitor stellar events, 10^19 cycles per second.

"This paper provides relevant context [Nikola Tesla and the planetary radio signals](http://www.teslasociety.com/mars.pdf). Additional context shows Tesla must have misinterpreted signals from the Jupiter-Io natural radio that include incremental pulses from 1 to 3 or 4 (that his early [VLF pulse envelope methods](http://www.teslasociety.com/teslarec.pdf) would have received) as a sign of intelligence. Jupiter and Mars were close enough in the sky at the time that he mistook one for the other. Unlike Tesla, now we know how that signal is produced and that it is a natural phenomenon that Jupiter and also Saturn can produce that does not indicate an intelligent source.

The additional context raises interesting questions. Was Tesla building ever more powerful radio transmitters in an attempt to communicate with his misinterpreted sign of intelligence? It seems like that may have been the case. His pre-1910 quenched gap radio transmitters were so powerful that quenched gap radio transmitters were banned entirely as one of the first radio regulations. One of Tesla's solutions to the problem of the extreme spectrum limitation imposed by everyone using global-strength radio transmitters was to use complex automatically varied modulation with multiple signals on multiple antennas. His idea was conceptually similar to contemporary radio signal multiplexing. It's probably better that lower power limitations were adopted instead of continuing to use his high power radio technology from the get-go, but it's a shame so much of his other technology has been shelved too.",Musk
"The problem is the whole Electric Grid Planet is a society designed by Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, in which Nikola Tesla never existed.

These are carefully crafted, this strange and sinister practice of taking the real and actual and distorting and twisting it to see how many will take the bait.

Reporters in the 1930's didn't have portable recording devices. Even the interview photo would have taken a separate photographer with a very large camera. Newspapers of the time would not be doing a movie camera filming with audio because that would have been a major production.  
  
The newspapers called Tesla an ""electrician"" from the 1800's to the 1920's, rarely calling him an inventor or what he actually was, an electrical engineer, actually the father of electrical engineering although electrical engineering was a university degree in the 1870's, DC only.

He was getting the electrostatic high potential by a fluid driven generator for the projector charge potential. He was firing a MASER down a barrel for the ray path and ionizing the nitrogen in the air to be the charged particles. The stream of highly charged protons would travel at sub-light speed to the target at a lower electric potential, the guidance system being a very high potential tower seeking any path to a lower potential target. The pencil thin beam would vaporize anything it contacted, a small beam but cutting like a knife if the target was moving.",Musk
"This is essentially the well-known trick to weld magnetic/magnetized material to wrap either the ground lead or the welding lead around the material in order to produce a counter/neutralizing magnetic field, but here it produces the magnetic field in the electrode instead of the material. Here are some references to that old trick. The simple idea is to use 3 to 5 turns of the welding electrode lead or the ground lead wrapped around a magnetic workpiece to stop the arc from being quenched by the magnetic field of the material.

Unlike magnetizing the work material, magnetizing the electrode produces a magnetic field perfectly aligned with the plasma current. The patent notes that the method improves weld quality. This might control the distribution of heat within the arc or the thermal boundary layer of the arc usefully somehow. It says the method reduces heating outside the arc too.

A field-aligned plasma current is also known as a Birkeland current as an planetary/cosmic phenomenon as Birkeland proposed in 1908, but that word doesn't appear anywhere in this, ^* and it's probably inappropriate outside of cosmic phenomena. *Plasma field-aligned current* would be sufficient. The term would be appropriate if this welder could be modified into a potentially useful model of solar plasma, which it possibly might.

This says the main point is to reduce visual overstimulation and eyestrain. Tesla mentioned his great aversion to visual overstimulation a number of times, [for example](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1900-06-00.htm): ""A long time ago, when I was a boy, I was afflicted with a singular trouble, which seems to have been due to an extraordinary excitability of the retina.  It was the appearance of images which, by their persistence, marred the vision of real objects and interfered with thought.""

The pinhole effect polarizes light, corrects focus-related vision problems and increases depth of field by minimizing the circle of confusion projected on the retina. People say these are helpful for reducing eyestrain from staring at computer screens for prolonged periods. To the extent they work, people with conditions making them susceptible to visual overstimulation and eyestrain (like migraines, epilepsy and autism-spectrum disorders) might potentially benefit from using them. They don't sharpen focus at only a single focal length like a lens, instead they sharpen focus at all focal lengths simultaneously. This increases depth of field allowing multiple focuses at different distances to all be focused simultaneously. Pinhole glasses also make the pupil dilate, and reducing reflexive contractions of the pupil could explain another method for how they reduce eyestrain. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_glasses  
https://web.phys.ksu.edu/papers/2008/pinhole-glasses-tpt.pdf

These are sort of like the ""x-ray spex"" sold to children in ads in old comics and pulp magazines. Both use the pinhole effect, but x-ray spex use the pinhole effect to produce a vision-obscuring outline around objects for the novelty in that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Ray_Spex

Contemporary pinhole glasses are available for sale today for prices around $10-40. Unfortunately they all seem to use holes of only one size unlike Guthrie's stenopeic equivalent of trifocal lenses with hole sizes to use in varying lighting. With pinhole glasses with only one small hole size, they only work with bright lighting and computer screens.

"Lightning rods seem innocuous enough. Benjamin Franklin invented them after his famous kite experiment around 1750. He originally hoped to discharge storm clouds besides also grounding lightning strikes more safely. That first function was based on unrealistic models as Franklin himself became aware by some point. He quit claiming that function for them eventually but without pointing out the previous error. Apparently popular science texts still contained his first erroneous explanation in 1919 for Tesla to address it in his [Famous Scientific Illusions](https://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/famous-scientific-illusions) essay.

The other of the two functions of lightning rods does work very well though. They ground lightning better than the structures they protect would. That is how Franklin saved the world from lightning-started building fires.

Lightning rods were essentially designed to do something they cannot do though. Franklin was right that a point could *attempt* to discharge clouds, because a point does produce a weak stream of electrons and ions in the air. In models, even tiny points could neutralize a model cloud, but that's only because the model couldn't hold a realistic charge and would be unrealistically conductive among other things. As Tesla pointed out, real clouds can contain many coulombs of charge, and the output of the lightning rod is small, so that even if the principle were not otherwise flawed, it would take too long. That's why lightning rods can't discharge storm clouds, but because they are designed to try to do that, they might do something unexpectedly very bad.

A strong unidirectional electric field such as is often maintained at the tips of lightning rods might be something we want to avoid because strong fields can deflect particles from cosmic ray air showers into the lower atmosphere, and cosmic ray air showers appear to impact health adversely. Cosmic rays and air showers both consist of ionizing radiation, so it makes sense how they could impact health like other energetic radiation causes sickness. They might even contribute to the evolution of pathogens indirectly. That is at least the inference one might be inclined to draw from how much worse the flu season has been when the cosmic rays levels are just a little higher than usual as they have been lately and were last summer.

Tesla's ellipsoidal cupolas avoid producing fields that could increase cosmic ray air shower particle deflection into the lower atmosphere, which 100 years after he patented them could now be very useful for helping mitigate negative effects from cosmic ray air shower penetration into the lower atmosphere.

He wrote about them in the New York Times in the late 1870's, in which Imperial Physicist JJ Thomson jumped in and started insulting Tesla as a ""mad man"", ""insane"", full of ""rubbish"", the usual Limey bullying tirade. This was when Tesla was a young immigrant, and JJ Thomson was considered one of the most prestigious physicists on the planet. 20 years later, Thomson officially announced he was the discoverer of the electron and quanta, that He Alone had proved the Indivisible Atom was divisible.

Carlson's book is a lot like Margaret Cheney's negative biography of Tesla from the 1980s. He basically considers Tesla a second-rate Elihu Thomson. He misinterprets the concepts Tesla gave Thomson as evidence of Tesla copying Thomson, which is funny but an understandable mistake. Perceiving Tesla through Edison's archive, he has an unfavorable opinion of Tesla and what he did.

No biographers have mentioned it, but I think it looks like Tesla invented hundreds of ideas he sold, gave away or simply allowed to be taken from him in order to advance technology. For some unknown reason he did this as selflessly as possible instead of trying to keep credit for everything he did for himself, which is strange. In retrospect it doesn't make sense, he would have impressed everyone a lot more if he had taken credit for everything he did, which should have helped him to accomplish much more. Maybe he wanted to do something incredibly selfless and noble for some reason. Maybe he was generous to a fault. It's an interesting question.

>had a seriously large number of patents later used in the transistor

Because you mentioned it, that is worth explaining in more detail. Tesla patented the first magnetic diode and amplifier in the 1880s. Magnetic amplifier technology (also known as the saturable reactor concept) doesn't seem to be used for anything anymore, but it was popular before vacuum tubes and remained popular through the 1950s. Simpler electromechanical variable resistors and inductors appear to have been his idea too, but he gave them away, because they're not much more complicated than electromagnetic relays. More importantly he seems to be the first person who ever thought of trying to vary the resistance of a resistor using purely electromagnetic means. It's not known how well his electromagnetically variable resistor concept worked. The patents about it seem to confuse most contemporary researchers who ignore the only brief point about his mysterious ""magnetic shield"" also being used as a conductor/resistor, but that was apparently the closest forerunner to semiconductor transistor technology. ^(*)No, sorry. Coherers with metal filings were even closer to semiconductors. Naturally he did things with them too. Coherers are essentially still around as transient protective varistors.^* He developed a lot of early semiconductor technology too. Carbon, silicon, silicon carbide, iron oxides, copper sulfide, copper oxides, selenium and silver oxide were some of the semiconductors Tesla is known to have worked with.

These patents are for a power transmission system that used either an AC or DC supply (like Gramme dynamos which could produce either) to generate pulses through capacitors to use traveling waves on transmission lines instead of the normal simpler circuit theory of the time. These are patents for a more advanced power transmission concept than our current polyphase distribution system (that Tesla invented and sold to Westinghouse two to three years after these patents).

This seems like the most likely candidate I have seen for the system Tesla mentioned inventing for Edison that Charles Batchelor later said had only been a joke. Tesla quit working for Edison over that incident in 1885. The joke seems like it may have been intended to discourage the ambitious newcomer, but it seems like it was only Batchelor trying to be discouraging rather than Edison. (It seems like Tesla and Edison actually got along amicably despite their differences probably until around 1915 when Edison's people started calling Tesla inept in order to deny him credit for his significant contributions to radio development.) If this were Tesla's, he might have sold it to fund his other projects like his motor and arc and other plasma lights.

The second patent described a system powered by DC, while the first was primarily about using an AC supply. One primary goal of these patents was to isolate generators to prevent transients from disabling generators, but in the process of overcoming that problem, a completely different method of power distribution was conceived, AC pulse power and resonant distribution.

The first patent is long at 12 pages. Word choices and example calculations provided sound like Tesla. There might even be a common anachronistic syntax with commas in parentheses. It contemplates powering circuits with phase offset components of the same traveling wave in Figs. 9 and 10. It mentions a small 4 uF capacitor such as was used for telegraphy could convert 2 KW of low frequency AC to HV pulsed power at 2 KV. It describes a *500 megawatt* transmission line resonator on page 7 using a 1 F capacitor running at 250 Hz and 2 KV with less than 1% loss with a 0.002 ohm transmission line section. I wonder how big a 1 F air capacitor like it mentions using would be. 

This would appear to be Tesla's transmission line standing wave resonator concept [as he described it in 1916](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/nt_on_ac.htm) including the same grand scale but at lower frequency than is usually associated with him. If Tesla did not give this concept to Fritts, it seems like he must have gotten it from Fritts, because it's the same concept of pulse power (producing a tremendous instantaneous power with capacitive discharge across a low resistance resonator).

"Could be part of it, nice idea.





Historians think the final straw was [an arc lighting system](http://edison.rutgers.edu/tesla.htm) that Tesla spent allot of time designing for Edison Electric, only to get shelved when Edison cut an arc lighting deal with another installing company (the threat of an Edison getting into the street lighting business may have been used as a scare tactic/bargaining chip to get a good deal from the other company). Tesla's loss of the bonus usually given to employees who design a major money making invention may have been the foundation of Tesla's bonus story. 









The only problem is it looks like Tesla walked out the door at Edison with his arc lighting designs and patented it a few month later with Edison's blessing (Edison's own patent attorney helped Tesla get the patents). Tesla lost those patents in 1886 when he was swindled out of his arc lighting company. Not sure how a Charles Fritts patent that predates that could be related to that.

Have you ever wondered what Tesla did with his early radio work? Looking over old patents, it looks like he gave or sold most of it to other early radio inventors like especially Harry Shoemaker, Cornelius Ehret and Greenleaf Pickard starting around 1900. Pickard was the only one of these people who I had previously heard of from his early radio diodes (crystal detectors) and radios. If I knew more radio history, I might have read about Ehret too because he invented frequency modulation in 1902, but maybe not because he has also become very obscure. There isn't even a Wikipedia page for him.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Shoemaker

Shoemaker's work was only described in a minority of radio texts from the time, but he has apparently often been considered the best early wireless telegraphy designer. Wikipedia says, ""His transmitter and receiver designs set the standard for the U. S. commercial radio industry up to World War One."" He was essentially the consumer version of Fritz Lowenstein, who only sold his designs that were influenced by Tesla to the US military. Considering how much so many of Tesla's and Shoemaker's inventions look alike, he appears to have been one of Tesla's proteges like Lowenstein.

This patent is for a device almost identical to the oscillator Tesla first demonstrated in 1897 with a capacitor inside the base and a circuit controller and output coil arranged perpendicular to each other. http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1919-07-00.htm

Of Shoemaker's patents, I thought this most clearly and immediately demonstrated a known device of Tesla's of decent complexity. Looking over Shoemaker's patents, you'll see a lot of identifiable ideas of Tesla's. He produced an incredibly large volume of ingenuous patents, 64 between 1901 and 1902 alone. He was the first to apply the Wheatstone bridge to wireless as Tesla had recommended repeatedly (including in patents like 685,954 from 1899).

As he mentioned in the 1919 article, Tesla started to manufacture his oscillators that year for radio, neon lighting, ozone, induction heating and other applications. He encountered some unknown issue though and never released them for sale. Maybe the issue was Shoemaker's patents. 

Shoemaker's patents could have previously played a key role in the legal drama of Tesla losing his rights to radio in 1915 too. Shoemaker worked for ~~Consolidated Wireless Telegraph~~~ American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Co. and International Telegraph Construction Co., who owned his first patents. Despite top notch patents, both companies went out of business. In 1908, a Marconi scam company, United Wireless Telegraph Co. purchased many wireless companies including both.

"This weird looking hemispherical aircraft was the first of many innovative aircraft Finley patented. It combines the best features of a parachute glider, the efficient lift from internal gas bags of a dirigible, the gyroscopic stability of a quadrotor helicopter, and it has a horizontal propeller like an airplane for speed. Finley would refer to his small aircraft like these as aerocruisers in later patents.

Tesla and Finley are not known to be connected in any way as far as I know, but we probably wouldn't know even if they were, because Tesla kept almost all of his involvement in anyone else's work secret. I actually found Finley's work recently by his use in later patents of some Tesla-related keywords, and he was someone active in the same time period. Not much is known about Tesla's work with flying machines, but he did talk about working with dirigibles sometimes, and he obtained a couple patents for a design for vertical takeoff and landing. Finley's aircraft all use gyroscopic forces to stabilize themselves, which was a feature Tesla talked about being important for flying machines. In his 1927 VTOL helicopter-plane patent (1,655,114), Tesla spent 139 lines explaining why top-rotor helicopters are unstable. This patent also addresses an issue Tesla pointed to in that patent with 9 lines about the need for safely landing in the event of engine failure.

Thomas Milton Finley doesn't appear to be well-known today. Looking at old magazines on the internet, the seaplanes he invented after all the fascinating dirigibles seem to have gotten more press coverage.

Are exotic aircraft boring? Is this only too speculatively related to Tesla? News articles do show Tesla experimenting with large balloons in the 1890s. http://imgur.com/a/BwLef Airships especially like Finley's should seem like a natural progression for him. Tesla and Gernsback had Frank R. Paul sketch lots of hypothetical airships.",Musk
"This appears to be pretty amazing and extremely simple. It's a solenoid electromagnet curled into a circle to turn a wheel-shaped core instead of pulling a tubular core like a normal electromagnet. It's a unipolar/homopolar/monopolar motor but with a ferromagnetic core to make it much more powerful than Faraday's conductive core. And it's incredibly simple. It's almost as simple as the Faraday disc dynamo it's based on.

To accommodate producing rotary motion instead of just pulling, the coil has to be doubled around to create a slot to allow the core of the electromagnet to connect to the shaft. The magnetic field is apparently polarized by making all the wires going one direction take an inner path while the return direction take an outer path. If there were only one path, the currents would produce directly opposing fields aligned so as to cancel rather than rotate the core. A multi-level coil structure to create a magnetic field of one polarity within an opposing field appears to have been a common design concept for Tesla. The Rogowski coil is a simpler example of this. That structure was invented much earlier than Rogowski and Steinhaus's 1912 analysis. Wikipedia says, ""A device similar to the Rogowski coil was described by Arthur Prince Chattock of Bristol University in 1887."" Tesla was clearly aware of the concept and capitalized on it by incorporating two into his 1897 driver coil that I'm always mentioning.

If the field of the inner wire track were contributing to moving the rotor, this wouldn't be very efficient. But it should be getting somewhat more field strength because the bends in the wire and pins that hold them should concentrate the magnetic field closer to the rotor.

Charles Powers's next patent from 1918 also looks pretty brilliant. It's a heater that heats a large sheet metal tube by induction. Besides the similarity of terms and concepts in both these patents, the diagrams in both look remarkably like Tesla's lithographs from the early 1890s. I found these patents searching keywords and phrases associated with Tesla from the period when he was most actively inventing. Tesla said he had a lot more ideas than he had time and energy to accomplish, which makes it sound like he sold or gave away a lot of inventions. A lot of terms and phrases Tesla and his associates used were unusual enough to make them identifiable (like *sigmoidal*, *ellipsoidal* and *concentric tubular*).

This motor would appear to be much simpler and cheaper than an induction or commutated DC or universal motor. I wonder why no one has ever built these motors. Was it simply too advanced for its time? Speaking of the universal motor, the Rhodes and Lamme patents look like Tesla too. https://www.google.com/search?q=""universal+motor""&tbm=pts&tbs=sbdo:1 In fact Rhodes patented a motor in 1912 almost identical to this, but his used normal coils and took power off the central core wheel at three small points using a planetary gearing. https://www.google.com/p",Musk
"The term ""photon"" was coined in 1926 not in reference to just light quanta but to a concept of a radiant energy carrier comprising matter and its conservation being a law of nature (photon conservation). The name was subsequently taken for the name of light quanta, and the original concept was eventually forgotten. It is an interesting idea though. Could thermal radiation be a small scale mass-energy conversion?

Could this have originally been Tesla's idea?

Gernsback once made it seem like Tesla said he didn't believe electrons exist, but that was probably deceptive or lazy editing. It's very difficult to believe that's what Tesla meant when he had been talking about negative particles in vacuum tubes regularly since the 1890s. Tesla's real point was most likely about Max Abraham's spherical electron model. Tesla's electron was presumably Parson's toroidal photon electron. https://gsjournal.net/Science-Journals/Research%20Papers-Quantum%20Theory%20/%20Particle%20Physics/Download/5523

The idea of an atom composed of photons presented here appears to be a closely allied concept.

Lewis, originator of Lewis dot diagram notation and the Lewis acid electronic theory of pH.

Speaking of the show, it looks like they might eventually build a plasma filament experiment.

^* I caught up with the show to episode 4 yesterday, so I guess I'll write some thoughts here.

The builders can't decide if they want to build an electrostatic generator or a Tesla coil. A Tesla coil-powered electrostatic generator seems like an obvious compromise, but they seem to be building a Tesla coil and acting like it is something more than it is for having such a chic terminal capacitance. It is annoying how they keep calling their Tesla coil a ""death ray."" You just built a big Tesla coil, guys. I'm sure it's dangerous, but calm down.

The missing ""Figure 5"" that they were looking for might be in this Leland Anderson-compiled document for sale for $22 from 21st Century Books. http://www.tfcbooks.com/mall/more/381tele.htm

"This is a large ceramic vacuum tube device where the plate element produces heat to use as a cooking surface. Heat is produced by electron bombardment produced by one or more thermionic cathode filaments. 

Tesla introduced electron bombardment ideas for lighting in his early 1890s lectures, so chances are pretty decent he suggested this device be developed if he did not invent it himself. He invented a lot of things that he sold or gave away because he liked inventing things but couldn't commercialize anything himself. He had a lot of consumer appliance ideas. For instance, it looks like his heating and cooling ideas show up most obviously in the patents of Arthur J Kercher and W. Wesley Hicks of the once-popular Wesix Electric Heater Company. https://www.trademarkia.com/wesix-72333956.html

There is no provision to increase the frequency from line current mentioned, so without additional circuitry, the electrons from each cathode-grid pair could be a rectified half of the mains sine wave. It seems like a faster oscillation should be more efficient, but the fact that it works at such a low frequency without needing any more control circuitry than that shown is impressively simple.

This stove element seems like it could double as a high power vacuum tube amplifier that could handle extreme resonant power multiplication much better than a normal vacuum tube (with fully internal plate). And with three cathodes or more, a heavy ring current might be produced on the plate. Or with only one cathode, the anode ring in the half wave version might be used to stimulate a ring current on the plate from its own ring resonance. The arrangement with the anode ring looks pretty similar to one of the diagrams from his early 1890s lectures but with electrons in vacuum instead of plasma in air. http://www.tfcbooks.com/images/lectures/1892-02-03/008.gif

">Spinning plasma toroids, or spinning spheromaks, are reported as forming in partial atmosphere during high-power electric arc experiments. They are a new class of spheromaks because they are observed to be stable in partial atmosphere with no confining external toroidal magnetic fields, and are observed to endure for more than 600 ms. Included in this paper is a model that explains these stable plasma toroids (spheromaks); they are hollow plasma toroids with a thin outer shell of electrons and ions that all travel in parallel paths orthogonal to the toroid circumference - in effect, spiraling around the toroid. These toroids include sufficient ions to neutralize the space charge of the electrons. This model leads to the name Electron Spiral Toroid Spheromak (ESTS). The discovery of this new class of spheromaks resulted from work to explain ball lightning. A comparison is made between the experimental observations of spheromaks in partial atmosphere and reported ball lightning observations; strong similarities are reported. The ESTS is also found to have a high ion density of ~ 10^19 ions/cm^3 without needing any external toroidal magnetic field for containment, compared, for example, to tokamaks, with ion density limits of ~ 10^15 ions/cm^(3). This high ion density is a defining characteristic and opens the potential to be useful in applications. The ESTS is a field reversed configuration plasma toroid.

The toroid is a shell of plasma that can stabilize itself without requiring any external fields for confinement or stabilization. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/6287639/6705689/6748850/6748850-fig-5-large.gif

>The EST will remain contained after initiation ... when a sufficient number of electrons are present and when the electrons are at an appropriate velocity to achieve a containing balance with external forces. This containing balance of forces occurs when the total charge trying to push the electrons outward matches the magnetic field created by the circulating electrons which tries to squeeze the electrons together.

Other external forces that can be used to stabilize the EST include the initiating magnetic field, an externally applied magnetic or electric field, or the repulsive force of ions in the atmosphere of the partial vacuum in the toroid chamber.

>The total charge of electrons creates a space charge. Because all electrons have the same charge, they will all repel each other.

The electrons in the hollow toroidal sheet can be accelerated to 25 KeV without significant losses in weak vacuum and faster with losses.

The way that a sheet of plasma is used here is almost as interesting as the plasma toroids themselves.

>The geometry of the toroid is such that all the electrons work together to repel air molecules. Collisions with air molecules-tend to be elastic, so all electrons remain in orbit during and after a collision. The electrons lose momentum (rotational energy) when repelling an incoming molecule.",Musk

"This idea combines a form of nuclear power with atmospheric energy harvesting. It uses radioactive lightning rods to collect atmospheric electrostatic energy. The radiation generates energy directly by the alpha/beta-voltaic effect and it increases the conductivity of the atmosphere, which increases the accessible electrostatic atmospheric energy. 

These patents were apparently all issued to various members of the same Belgian family with the surname Capart. 

According to another patent, radioactive lightning rods can also be used to suppress hail by the choice of radioactivity used. Hail occurs more commonly in places where the ground emits more negative radiation, so radioactive lightning rods that emit positive particles can offset or neutralize the negative space charge that makes hail more likely to occur there. 

As far as connections to Tesla, atmospheric energy harvesting was his big idea. He also said he had invented a static interference preventer that he never revealed, and one of these patents is for putting radioactive material on a radio antenna to prevent static. The static preventer he talked about was probably a particular radio transformer, but he had a number of inventions to prevent static. This could also be one of them. This radioactive antenna prevents static by preventing electrostatic dust that causes the dust component of radio static noise from sticking to the antenna. 

These patents also include one for using radioactive lightning rods to protect pigeons and other direction-sensitive birds from becoming disoriented during storms. Pigeons, migratory birds and other direction-sensitive birds are all sensitive to electric fields. The strong field fluctuations and radioactive dust during storms disorient them so badly they may never find their way back home to their nest again. A radioactive lightning rod on a building can prevent that and keep your pigeons safe.

"In the experiment he is just forming an electron-ion chain of dark plasma through the air to the electrostatic generator, isn't he? Can that principle be applied to atmospheric energy harvesting? Could a flame create a conductive plasma column all the way to the ionosphere (60 km)? It might, especially with enough voltage, but it's worth noting he didn't demonstrate that.

The simplest way to think about this is to recognize that flame is neutral/bipolar plasma, so it rapidly equalizes an electrode in contact with it with the surrounding field(s). That is how flame electrostatic charge collectors that are used to measure atmospheric potential work. http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Flame_collector

[Plauson's 1921 patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US1540998) showed among many other things how a flame can be used with a capacitor and resonator to extract power from positive ions by pulsed electron emission especially from a terminal heated by the flame to stimulate thermal electron emission. 

With sufficient power, the plasma could itself be used as the electron emitter, but it's hard to imagine such a large input power could be re-collected in order to make that process produce energy. It would probably look really impressive to form a column of visible plasma extending into the sky beyond sight though.

Tesla and Plauson said positive atmospheric ions can be harnessed to produce power. Terrestrial ionizing radiation (especially radon) and cosmic rays produce energetic atmospheric ions. The most abundant are protonated water clusters. https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wcosray.html An Estonian observatory monitoring station measured around 1000 to 1400 large heavy ions (22-79 nm Aitken particles) per cc of air. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JD003240/pdf There is diurnal variation in ion counts around 40%, but ions are available through the night.

There is only a little atmospheric power available as direct current because ions especially large ions cannot move to a terminal quickly and efficiently in a direct line without interruption. That is how Jefimenko's simple atmospheric power system worked and why it only collected a little power. The electrolytically sharpened points Plauson used would probably be an improvement",Musk

It seems like Tesla would later use plasma beams instead of balloons and towers for the elevated capacitance. ^* The Tesla-Plauson atmospheric energy harvesting system contemplated collecting positive ions by resonant absorption though, so this is different. ^** This claims to harness terrestrial guided waves though. Terrestrial guided waves were Tesla's alternative to Hertz radio.

This patent doesn't draw any attention to the point explicitly, but there should be much more energy in guided waves than radio waves. It takes a guided wave receiver to see that because a radio only picks up the tiny amount of the energy in guided waves like radio waves.

"In this 2001 presentation Bruce Perreault makes a number of interesting claims. The recording doesn't start right at the beginning, but I believe this was at least his third conference presentation, so he had gotten pretty decent at presenting by this time. 

He says Tesla's cosmic ray energy really meant atomic energy. Heavy radioactive elements represent vast stores of energy ultimately derived from the sun and space. I still think Tesla was most likely referring to atmospheric electrostatic energy (and the radiation that produces it), but Perrault's explanation is also plausible. Either way, radioactivity presents a means to harness atmospheric energy and atmospheric energy is in large part due to radioactivity, so they are closely related ideas.

He plays a recording by Tesla's lab assistant Arthur Matthews he received in the 1980s in which Matthews talks about meeting Tesla and the electric car Tesla was rumored to have built. That car did not run by wireless power like many assumed. It ran on some sort of ultra high energy density battery that consumed zinc electrodes. That battery may have been rechargeable too, and you could either recharge it or put new electrodes in.

Perreault claims what some have referred to as ""cold electricity"" is really just low voltage high frequency current, and while its properties are novel, nothing about it defies any known physics. It doesn't heat wires very much compared to lower frequencies, but it's not actually cold. It seems to be safe to touch. It won't shock you even if you use it with bare wires in salt water. That is very different from more common forms of current, but it doesn't have anything to do with deriving energy from new sources as some have claimed. 

He presents the theory that Thomas Henry Moray's power-receiving radio (that he invented before his tubes) worked by drawing ground radon to its ground plate. I think this idea has merit. It would also explain Nathan Stubblefield's apparatus. I assumed Stubblefield's coil must have worked by adsorbing radium to the wire, but I hadn't considered the possibility of concentrating mobile ground radon before. 

He says Moray's atomic power tubes were not radioactive when he tested them, but they became extremely radioactive when powered. He doesn't explain how that occurs unfortunately. I've speculated Moray's tubes may have worked by generating positronic radionuclides like Al-26, but the radiation could also be from x-rays alone. Whatever radiation they use, Moray's tubes are a form of direct conversion nuclear power. 

As an aside unrelated to this video, I believe Al-26 and similar radionuclides are Tesla's aluminum power invention that he mentioned once or twice but never described in any detail. It's a form of nuclear power that works by positronic disintegration of aluminum and certain other elements in tubes like Moray's. 

Perreault talks briefly about his own direct conversion nuclear power tubes that use radon gas or a radon-emitter lik",Musk
"Re: autistics & cannabis
There are some interesting studies related to autistics benefiting from cannabis.
It may be more CBD (non psychoactive) neuro impact.
Regardless, it does add a dimension, when you consider very high reported rates of use vs general pop, in autistics.

"Is this article available anywhere on the internet? Was this a real experiment?

^* It seems like this probably was real and intended to demonstrate the operative principle in Tesla's 1901 radiant energy patents ([US 685,957](https://www.google.com/patents/US685957)[&8](https://www.google.com/patents/US685958)) and Plauson's 1921 atmospheric electric energy patent ([US 1,540,998](https://www.google.com/patents/US1540998)), which is using pulsed electron emission to stimulate resonant absorption of positive ions from the atmosphere.

During a storm, there might be enough positive ions in the air to power a small neon bulb with an elevated terminal as short as depicted without needing the sparking electrostatic generator, but during fair weather it would presumably require those extra ions. The additional ion source would not be necessary with a taller collector, tethered balloon or an actively powered charge collector.

Extracting positive ions from the atmosphere like this could have benefits besides energy harvesting. Natural positive air ions are unhealthy, and most air pollution consists of or becomes positive ions by photoionization, so large scale positive ion extraction could be used to mitigate air pollution. Part of the heat of the atmosphere must consist of positive ions, so extracting positive ions should also be extracting heat from the air.",Musk
"This could be nothing, but it looks pretty good as far as these sorts of things go. The author summarizes other patents like it and explains how they could work. Like most quantum/vacuum energy schemes, this uses potential to harness another source of energy in a multiple-step process. In this case the second energy source is the current on an LC resonator.

In its simplest form, the concept of using potential to harness energy from an external source rather than using power from the potential source to do work directly like normal can be seen in how neutral objects can be made to rotate around an electrostatic potential without using energy from the potential. The potential is not giving the neutral objects energy to make them orbit but instead simply reorganizing their energy that could have previously summed to zero into coherent energy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NbCzbDdd-g",Musk
"Anybody that has contacted the FBI with a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) request knows exactly what happens. First, they have some flunky whose job is to send back a form reply saying, ""The FBI has conducted an extensive search and found no records relating to the request"". Basically, the FOIA is going to the front desk receptionist. If somebody gets a lawyer after that and starts talking about getting a subpoena, then suddenly, the FBI will go, ""Whoops, we did find some material but it is of a sensitive nature, possibly compromising National Security"", then they send pages all black-lined (redacted) so it's almost impossible to determine what the contents of the document really are.

"John G. Trump was an EE professor. Here's his [doctoral thesis on vacuum electrostatics](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/32556) from 1933.

In this report from 1943, he dismissed the military value of Tesla's notes that had been withheld from being released to his family by a wartime government agency, the Office of Alien Property. Part of his reason for this was because, as the report noted at several points, Tesla had already disclosed important ideas to people in relevant industries, military scientists (like his assistant Bloyce Fitzgerald) and physicists like presumably especially Arthur Compton and Alfred Parson. In a 1933 interview, Tesla said he barely slept, so despite people around him saying he was as sharp as ever, you wouldn't expect him to have been doing his best work by that point in his life. His mechanical vibration ideas were probably motivated by having sold all of his electromagnetic wireless power intellectual property to Morgan to fund half of the expense of building Wardenclyffe.

^* There are links available for a lot of these papers included in the report.

- Exhibit C: Process of De-Gassifying, Refining, and Purifying Metals - 41-page memo - not available but critiqued harshly by Margret Cheney and Bernard Carlson

- Exhibit D: Soviet physicists at Amtorg asked Tesla to explain more about how his turbine electrostatic generator worked, which Trump dismissed as resembling the work of Van de Graaff. Van de Graaff's version was really the poor imitation though. Alfred W. Simon patented what looks like a scaled down version of Tesla's idea in 1933. https://www.google.com/patents/US2004352

- Exhibit E: Art of Telegeodynamics or Art of Producing Terrestrial Motions at Distance - 1940 letter to Westinghouse proposing long range power transmission by mechanical vibration. In this he appears to have been revisiting his early work with electromechanical oscillators and resonance but with the concept scaled up presumably more than possible. It certainly seems pretty fantastic even for Tesla.

The FBI claims they didn't know what was in the safe or the trunks because the Office of Alien Property collected all the material. In an earlier letter, the FBI says Tesla's nephew was the first to open the safe. The Office of Alien Property just acted on their own, without contacting the FBI, the national security agency at the time? The big glaring fact being squirmed around is why was Office of Alien Property contacted, when Nikola Tesla was a Naturalized US Citizen?   
  
This is the entire John Trump ""analysis"" of what was in the trunks, as requested by Office of Alien Property, yet is in the FBI files -- after the FBI said for decades they didn't know what was in the trunks.

"The mods astutely tagged this as ""crystal radio."" Well done!

For those too young to have heard of a crystal radio, it is a small simple radio receiver which requires no batteries and is powered only by the radio signal which it receives. This circuit is very similar, however instead of being tuned to a specific frequency it converts the net amplitude of surrounding EM and converts it not to a sound in an earpiece but to usable DC current.

An interesting thing about this circuit is that it can be scaled up indefinitely to power anything from small devices to entire campsites or, theoreticaly, even more. It could also be scaled down to remotely power things like IoT devices, RFID, or small low-draw medical devices.",Musk
"This wasn't the worst video about Tesla but it was pretty generic, not much new, and there were a few misleading comments made.  
  
One interesting part is the image of the newspaper page that prompted the Ivory Tower of Physics to ban-hammer Tesla.  
https://i.imgur.com/5c9XPob.jpg  
  
Tesla was banned, black-balled and made the eternal butt of ridicule for the Physics Royalty due to that article. It was Tesla's explanation of how Wardenclyffe tower would make AC electric power available over a large area without wires. Tesla didn't know he was saying anything controversial, just explaining the physics of how it worked. All Tesla said was that he would make the Earth's static electric field oscillate so that it would become AC. This explanation actually drove the top tier of the elite physicists crazy, and they couldn't tolerate it. That is why there is the famous photo of the physics elite meeting at the time, deliberately without Tesla, and he was hurt he wasn't invited.

Tesla did all the testing for Wardenclyffe during his Colorado Springs trials, and it was how he developed the idea for a large scale system.  
  
The part about trying to come up with a modern PC (politically correct) term for his ""death ray"" is weak. Tesla, at the time, was annoyed by the press insistence on calling it a ""death ray"", not because of the word ""death"" but the use of the word ""ray"", so calling it ""peace ray"" fixes nothing. Tesla clearly explained it was a charged particle beam weapon, not using ""rays"". Also, it is kind of an Urban Legend to say nobody knew what it looked like. The little unknown part of history is that Tesla tried to prevent World War II, and sent letters to most of the planet's head of state, with detailed diagrams of the charged particle beam. This was in 1937. Neville Chamberlain was on the verge of supporting Tesla to develop the weapon, when suddenly, Chamberlain cut off all communications with Tesla. So, it is Urban Legend that nobody knew what the weapon would have looked like.

"That looks terrible. It seems like fiction about Tesla always is.

The concept of a radio for talking to ghosts is something Tesla was said to have mentioned in his sanguine first decade in the US, but the only statement he ever made to reporters about the idea was that it had been a silly hope.

Decades later, [Edison released a statement about working on a spirit radio in 1920](https://books.google.com/books?id=2phOAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA9). And his journal shows that he was still working on the idea until the last years of his life. http://www.techtimes.com/articles/37949/20150308/thomas-edison-idea-speak-dead.htm

Even more decades later, in the late '70s and early '80s, there was a guy who said he did this successfully, but disassociative personality disorder (previously known as multiple personality disorder) would be a more mundane and logical explanation. http://www.angelsghosts.com/spiricom  
http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm

The most important invention that people don't realize Tesla and Edison feuded over was narrow bandwidth radio tuning or what is known as four-circuit radio. Hertz discovered two-circuit radio, but two-circuit radio wastes practically all its power with its wide bandwidth, so it cannot transmit a signal as far as a very inefficient light could be seen. After Marconi tried but failed to come up with anything else to improve his own two-circuit radio, Edison helped Marconi steal Tesla's invention. Edison's greatest invention was really his heavily funded publicity and self-promotion, which is how he was able to take credit for whatever he wanted. (That is a simple version. It's really all more complicated than that though, because Tesla invented the four-circuit concept, but probably out of some foolish sense of generosity, he only wanted his patent to cover its use for guided waves. Despite that limitation, it was still Tesla's right to license his four-circuit tech to Lowenstein for use with radio waves, which is what Marconi Co. sued Lowenstein for in 1915.)",Musk
"This is consistent with anything modern. Maths leads science by 100-500 years and science leads engineering by 30-100 years. I.e. What maths guys are working on now (string theory) won't be provable by science for 100-500 years. Once the science is proven/understood it will take another 30-100 years to build useful stuff out of it. 
Sometimes it's faster and sometimes a lot slower, but this is how it generally goes. That's why it's sad to see so many cuts to pure science as that's what creates the technology that engineers will integrate into devices/vehicles/structures in several decades time. Any delay on the science is a delay on our shared future getting more awesome. ",Musk
"This says almost nothing yet it was still condescending. 

It only describes inductive coupling--like a spaced out transformer or a toothbrush charger system--but Tesla actually invented magnetic resonant coupling, which is more complex and more effective at a distance.

"Terrible casting, Cumberbatch as Edison. Cumberbatch would have been much better as Tesla. This movie is also trying to portray Westinghouse as the main supporter of AC (alternating current). It's pretty obvious that Tesla is never going to get a break in the US, or ever recognized as the real person he was. Probably ""The Prestige"" with David Bowie as Tesla is going to be the closest Hollywood ever gets to portraying Tesla.  
  
Thomas Edison only attended school for a couple years and was home schooled into his teens by his mother. He found a lot of fascination in rail yards, and grew up a very rough character from those experiences, including hopping trains, trying to set up a chemistry lab in a freight car that caught fire, and getting boxed in the ears, worsening his deafness. Edison was not sophisticated, many of his inventions came about by brute force, or stealing other peoples' ideas and getting them to work. He was a tremendous power house of energy, and almost superhuman in his tirelessness when pursuing an invention. His character was much more a ruffian than some sophisticated intellectual.

"It was claimed that he took something like 30 million documents. Just to put that in to perspective...

A ream of paper is 500 sheets.

A box of 10 reams is 5000 sheets.

A pallet of 40 boxes is 200,000 sheets

A 53ft long Semi trailer of 26 pallets is 5.2mil sheets.

So they're claiming that Obama secretly made off with about 6 full semi trailers worth of documents.....and nobody noticed?",Obama

"I love the guy's humor. I miss the days where our leader wasn't insane or senile, or both.

Tiptop. Compliments his wife like a boss, then self-deprecates like a human. Very wholesome.

"> It is not clear when it first began circulating, but it was shared online during Obama's presidency.

But:

> A video of the late comedian Joan Rivers mocking Michelle Obama and Barack Obama with the conspiracy theory has also begun to recirculate online.

> The video, from 2014, sees Rivers speak with a journalist on the street in an impromptu interview.

It?s all about the boiling hate by half of whites in America that a Black man became president TWICE. That hate boiled so hot that reversing everything back to Jim Crow era was the only thing that would appease them. Trump is actually their puppet not the puppet master. Their support feeds his narcissism which in turn gives them the cover to be racist and pretend it?s about saving America because he used to say what they couldn?t say at first ?- in summary all they?re angry about is summed up as ?- ?How the fcuk did y?all make a ni**er become the president of these United States TWICE?? Make Murikkka White Again!.,Obama

"""I have made a point of not commenting on your service in my successor's administration and have always spoken highly of you both in public and in private. You always served me and my family well, and I have considered you not only a fine doctor and service member but also a friend,"" Obama wrote in the email to Jackson, according to Fox's report.  
""That's why I have to express my disappointment at the cheap shot you took at Joe Biden via Twitter,"" Obama continued. ""It was unprofessional and beneath the office that you once held. It was also disrespectful to me and the many friends you had in our administration. You were the personal physician to the President of the United States as well as an admiral in the U.S. Navy. I expect better, and I hope upon reflection that you will expect more of yourself in the future.""",Obama

"Discovery in this case revealed that Dominion?s own employees expressed serious concerns about the security of its machines. 

Mark Beckstrand, a Dominion Sales Manager, confirmed that other parties ?have gotten ahold of [Dominion?s] equipment illicitly? in the past.  Beckstrand identified specific instances in Georgia and North Carolina and testified that a Dominion machine was ?hacked? in Michigan.  Beckstrand confirmed that these security failures were ?reported about in the news.?

And just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Dominion?s Director of Product Strategy and Security, Eric Coomer, acknowledged in private that ?our shit is just riddled with bugs.?  Indeed, Coomer had been castigating Dominion?s failures for years. In 2019, Coomer noted that ?our products suck.?  He lamented that ?[a]lmost all? of Dominion?s technological failings were ?due to our complete f? up in installation.?

And in another instance, he identified a ?*critical* bug leading to INCORRECT results.? Ex.H4, Coomer Email (Jan. 5, 2018). He went on to note: ?It does not get much worse than that.? Id. And while many companies might have resolved their errors, Coomer lamented that ?we don?t address our weaknesses effectively!?",Trump

"But Raffensperger wasn?t the only one to lie to the President of the United States on that call from the President after the 2020 Election.

Ryan Germany, Raffensperger?s attorney was at his side on the call.  Both Raffensperger and Germany lied by omission.  Germany was provided a report from an individual by the name of Carter Jones who was hired by Raffensperger to inspect the Fulton County election process.  In this report, they were made aware of numerous activities that occurred at the State Farm Arena in Fulton Country.

In this report, Jones even sent a picture of what was going on at the arena late on election night and he noted that ballots were shoved through tabulators more than once.

I understand going along with trying to attached blame to Trump but it's a bitch move. It's like blaming video games for violence, plenty of people play video games and don't steal cars etc. Plenty of people showed up on J6 and didn't break windows to get inside. Trump can't be blamed for what a small number did. And the people who just walked inside after the doors were opened shouldn't be charged either.",Trump
"Some probably think they know all there is to know about Trump. They probably think the Mueller report exonerated him. Well, no matter what they think they know, do they know about Trump's real Russian connections from the seventies/eighties? They had best read a fascinating fact based report primarily about Boris Johnson and several other British Prime Ministers in which Trump is mentioned en passant.

The report was produced by Bill Fairclough an ex-spook (ex MI6/CIA) but unlike the dirty dossier produced by Christopher Steele (ex MI6) this report is fact based and much of it has been accepted as fact by several British Prime Ministers. Just Google ""Britain's Dismal Dossier on Russian Political Infiltration"". Make sure you read the latest version (July 2021) and do read the three short articles referred to in the penultimate paragraph. Rest assured, your understanding of world politics will never be the same again.

"How come Spain, France and Britain aren't the ones who are blamed for slavery?  Why does America (and mainly American white dudes) catch the blame? The United States didn't start slavery. It wasn't their idea. From 1492 until 1776 the slave trade & practice of slavery was under the control of the European colonizers. If anything Americans (American white dudes) are the heroes in this story. It took them almost 80 years of struggleand strife, but they fought a war and bled and died in order to unwind and dismantle the systemic slavery that their European overlords had forced upon them for 300 years

"James Biden secretly negotiated a $140 million settlement deal in 2012 between a U.S. company and the Saudi Arabian government due to his relationship with then-Vice President Joe Biden, court documents reveal.

The revelation represents one more instance of the Biden family business peddling influence while President Joe Biden was an elected official. House Oversight Committee James Comer (R-KY) reportedly already has copies of the court documents and is investigating the scandal as a part of his probe into the Biden family for nine violations, including wire fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering.",Trump

"In short, the Biden administration has declared that universal childcare is the key to unlocking women?s untapped potential to contribute to the GDP. It has partnered with the World Bank to make childcare universally available and to pay countries for complying with their policy requirements. They will also produce data showing that childcare provides the best outcomes for children and will use ?regulation and monitoring systems? to influence how childcare centers are run. To put a fine point on it, a global childcare scheme has been launched with the objective of getting little children away from their mothers and fathers and convincing parents, and society at large, that this is a great idea that will empower women, enrich children, and save the world.

This U.S. strategy is in line with what one early Russian socialist said: ?To oblige the mother to give her child to the Soviet state ? that is our task.? He explained that to get mothers to surrender their children, the government would provide comprehensive care centers for all children where they would be ?supervised by trained pedagogical and medical personnel? who would fulfill the children?s educational, physical, social, and emotional needs for essentially the first two decades of their lives. What mother could resist this great deal for her child?",Trump

"I congratulate the person who wrote this, because they're trying to engage.  Don't we all want to be asked, why we love Trump so much?  The question might be rude but it doesn't matter.  I respect the person that posted.

I will simply say this there are two completely different worlds, one is the world of business and real life experience and the other is based on academic theories and Left of politics ideologies.

Trump is a very powerful and experienced person in the real world, what actually works rather than beautiful sounding series.  I middle-aged I've done many things, I've been in sales, run my own business I've been involved in high-level negotiations.  My real world experience makes me absolutely convinced that Trump is excellent in terms of judgement and negotiation.

But I mentioned that there were two worlds and they are so different, if you're in the left-wing educational bubble, all your friends pour scorn on from, everyone smokes weed.  I don't mean to put you in a box.  I should imagine you care deeply about important issues like environment and animal welfare.  So do I the problem is you are literally Warriors, social justice Warriors, you don't want peace or working together or respecting others opinions you want to win.  It's kind of demonstrated by the title of your post.  But it's all.   Something changed not long ago people could be friends and have different opinions politically, they could discuss things with each other and they would respect a democratic vote.  Now it's a sort of total war.  I believe that is the modern leftist political ideology.  I'll stop there.  Wish you the very best",Trump
"Disingenuous question. You don't really care.  But in my experience no leftist does actually care. No, you're all soulless, nihilistic smartasses who never take anything seriously.  Every dumb, racist ""friend"" I ever had growing up turned into one. A useless, slobby degenerate who just wants free shit.",Trump

   We like being respected on the world stage. Not the current laughing stock of the world we are now. We like a leader who speaks their mind, not giving a canned answer prepped by lawyers, polls or political pundits. 
   We like affordable housing, cheap energy and food. We like stable inflation rates, not one pushing towards 10%. 
   We like law and order, equal application of the law to all. Not one set of rules for the elites and another for the peons. We like good race relations, not the constant pushing of policies that attempt to reverse all the gains we?ve made and return us to the 60?s.
  We like good public education for our kids. Teaching them the basics that will lead to high test scores and set them up for success later in life. Focusing exclusively on reading, writing and arithmetic?not teaching kids anything sexual outside of the ?Birds and the Bee?s 101? in sex ed class. 
   We believe in promoting a strong nuclear family, not policies that tear down traditional nuclear families. Countries fall when nuclear families don?t succeed. 
   We believe in overall freedom to live our lives as we see fit, without government interference. This includes the right to medical autonomy and not being forced into being a Guinea pig in a drug trial or risk losing our livelihood. 
   Most of all we miss the year 2019 and the glorious years that preceded it.",Trump

"Norfolk Southern, the railway company behind the Ohio derailment on February 3rd that forced a town to mass evacuate, had record profits in 2022 despite employee reductions and lackluster treatment of existing workers.  Did Norfolk Southern forego safety in lieu of profits?

Found two posts by citizens provided below.

""While they have everyone chasing UFOs, they're hiding the fact that Ohio is experiencing a Chernobyl tier disaster after a train derailment released toxic carcinogens into one of the most fertile areas in America. 

Journalists reporting on it are being arrested.""

""An entire town can?t return home because water is contaminated, livestock/crops are being destroyed, reporters are being arrested.""

""This is how the sky [reportedly] look[ed] around incident site in Ohio after police detonated chemicals in a ""controlled release"" effectively dispersing airborne carcinogens across Ohio.""

""Ohio derailment when local officials ""strategically detonated"" the five train cars with vinyl chloride and other toxic cancer-causing chemicals releasing them into the air.

People in the area have reported the death of chickens, fish, and other animals. One resident  ""let their 2-year-old healthy dog out to go to the bathroom, and the dog never returned inside. He was dead in the yard.""'


After a train derailment, Ohio residents are living the plot of a movie they helped make.

"The Washington Post is being accused of racism by a Hispanic lawmaker from Florida.

Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida said its recent profile on her was riddled with errors, according to Fox News.

?It?s awful how [The Washington Post] treat[s] minorities. And the fact is, is that their undertone of their article was incredibly racist. They tried to undercut my Hispanic heritage. They even spoke to my mother and did report a lot of what she was posting. So, The Washington Post is compost, and they should do better,? she said during a Friday appearance on the Fox News show ?Jesse Watters Primetime.?

?My story is something that they didn?t want to believe is true. Again, I grew up within the welfare system. I went to over six high schools. My parents were never married. And I also think one of the craziest claims that they?re trying to say is that I wasn?t raised as a messianic Jew,? Luna said.

Luna said the errors were part of the Post?s intention to attack her.

My question is how can they claim to be against racism when they attack white people and now this ?",Trump

"Former NASA Astronaut and US Navy Captain Scott Kelly, a committed leftist, took to Twitter to plead with Elon Musk to help prevent the ?genocidal invasion? of Ukraine.

Scott Kelly, whose brother Mark is a US Senator from Arizona, is a tool of the left and supporter of escalating the war in Ukraine.

Kelly wants Elon Musk to allow his Starlink satellites to ramp up functionality and assist the Biden regime and NATO in their war on Russia.

Elon did not mince his words in his response, telling Kelly to quit swallowing the lies from the media and other propaganda BS.",Trump
" Ukraine has been using StarLink for military command and control. Ukraine has begun equipping explosive drones with StarLink transceivers to remove radio distance limitations. So far Russia has been radio locating ground based terminals, verifying they are military and targeting them. But, Russia is building electronic warfare suites they can use to jam the satellites as they pass over over the region. This jamming may cause permanent damage that would be extremely costly to Musk. Musk will disable StarLink coverage of the region to protect his investment if it is at risk.",Trump

The mysterious document was sent unsolicited to Tarrio?s Telegram immediately prior to January 6th by a ?love interest? named Erika Flores.

"I remind you that Hungary is a democratic country that is a member of the European Union and the NATO alliance. It is led by a government that won re-election in a 2022 landslide that was widely recognized as free and fair. This is also a government that does not support the United States-led strategy to prolong the Russia-Ukraine war, does not believe in globalist principles on open immigration, does not support same-sex marriage, and will not permit LGBT propaganda to be presented to minors.

Clearly it is ripe for a Color Revolution -- and Samantha Power is here to help.

?[Brook Jackson] observed:

fabrication and falsification of blood draw information, vital signs, signatures and other essential clinical trial data;

enrollment and injection of ineligible clinical trial participants, including Ventavia employees? family members;

failure to timely remove ineligible patients? data from the trial;

failure to maintain temperature control for the vaccine at issue;

failure to monitor patients after injection as required by the trial protocol;

principal investigator oversight failures;

use of unqualified and untrained personnel as vaccinators and laboratory personnel;

failure to maintain the ?blind? as required, which is essential to the credibility and validity of the observer-blinded clinical trial;

ethical violations, such as failure to secure informed consent and giving patients unapproved compensation;

improper injection of the vaccine (i.e., by over-diluting vaccine concentrate or using the wrong needle size);

failure to ensure that trial site staff were properly trained as required by good clinical practices;

safety and confidentiality issues, including HIPAA violations; and

other violations of the clinical trial protocol, FDA regulations, and Federal Acquisition Regulations and their DoD supplements.

Ventavia failed to report the majority of its clinical trial protocol and regulatory violations to Pfizer or the external Institutional Review Board. Issues were improperly documented or hidden away in ?notes to the file,? and not corrected?

If any FDA regulations had been legally operative, then the whole project would have been stopped by FDA long before human sham-trials could even begin.

Red flag stopping points showed up in the very earliest animal studies, one of which was conducted between July 16, 2020 and Sept. 24, 2020, concurrent with the sham human trials, and eventually provided by Pfizer/Acuitas/DOD to FDA in November 2020.",Trump
