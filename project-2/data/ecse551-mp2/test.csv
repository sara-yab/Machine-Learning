0,"I just used it for the first time as an experiment, to pour in a fuel additive. Worked like a charm. I think I might try to find a rubber washer to add near one end. That's to prevent accidentally pushing it in past the opening mechanism - it looks like making that mistake would Really Suck. Or I guess I could use heat to flare it out a bit on one end."
1,"Honestly I?d rather stick with the old sync 3 smaller screen with buttons, I?ve nearly been in an accident because I was cut off as I reached over to click a Sirius recommendation, imagine if I had to look down to change climate or something, FUCK THAT!

I?d rather be feeling for knobs rather than looking at and touching screens"
2,"As a proud owner of a 2021 Edge Titanium, this was one of the selling points for me...SYNC 4A with wireless charging. It has worked well about 99% of the time. The touch controls take a bit to get used to and it takes eyes away from the road but I have pretty much adjusted to the flow.

As for the noise question asked in another comment, my car is very very quiet and I have had lots of complements from colleagues when they ride in it. Overall very satisfied. I had my eyes on a Mach-E but it simply does not offer the same bang for the buck as the Edge."
3,"I actually don't hate the implementation. The climate controls are always at the bottom of the screen, and IIRC the older screen still hid some of the climate control options in the screen anyway and you had to dig through a menu to get to them. This is better than that."
4,It's stupid. Relying on one thing to control many is never a good plan. Plus it's a major distraction. Having a tactile button you can feel means you don't have to look to make sure you're doing what you want to be doing. Having to avert your eyes to a screen to make sure you hit the right thing is ridiculous
5,"I like cars with screens...as long as the UI is intuitive and phone-like. I've never driven a new Edge nor have I driven a Ford with Sync 3.

As far as I can tell, it looks good and concise. I like it."
6,"I?ve had a 2021 Edge for 3 months now. 

I really enjoy the screen, but they need a few updates. Like the heated seats, I shouldn?t have to click multiple buttons to change one setting. Just let me click the seat the cycle the heat levels and off like the button in my old Fusion did. Feels like multiple options need multiple unnecessary clicks. Anyone that wasn?t born with a smartphone in their diaper will probably have issues changing settings while driving. 

And ultimately I should have more screen organization and theme options, it?s just a big touchscreen. Let me get half the ish off the screen. Should really be able to have my gps app up AND music up at the same time."
7,"I have the 22 edge with this screen. It?s pretty great besides no dedicated ac buttons/knobs, recirculation, and max ac.

The games are actually pretty fun when you?re waiting at a drive through or picking someone up. 

CarPlay is massive and taller than normal so that?s a plus."
8,Probably the ugliest interior swap ever. It doesn't match the air vents at all. They even took away the handy little cover that hides that compartment space on the bottom. Someone knew they were gonna discontinue the Edge ahead of time.
9,"I'm not seeing it in the video, but in my dad's Super Duty I remember there being a small slot in it, and you stick the seatbelt buckle into that to release it. His is an 08 so it may be different in yours."
10,"Indifferent but lean towards the older Sync 3 because I own a 18 Fusion.

Having driven the new Edge and Mach-e, the large Sync 4A is one of the better designed systems on the market as more layout and controls are exactly where you want them. That being said, it can be a distraction when on the move, but thankfully Ford has one of the better voice control setups as well on the market."
11,"Odd that it went bad again so quickly. It?ll be SPW no problem, and as long a sits documented they won?t have any problem getting Ford to pay for it.

When did they get one? Iv been waiting for a Taurus RDU for 3 months now"
12,"Went to start my car and steering assist fault service require came on. When i went to move the car, two more warnings came up, the hill start and the advancetrac. Disconnected battery over night but still showed up. Checked fuses and power steering fuse was fine. 

Battery replaced one week ago.
Break pads replaced 10 days ago.

Edit: ended up being the power steering assist motor."
13,"I have a 2016 F150, got the exact same messages the other day when I was (allegedly) doing donuts in a dirt parking lot. Went away after I shut the truck down and turned it on the next day. Worth noting I screwed up my alignment while doing this.

That being said, when I googled it I came to countless sources saying that essentially the traction control system gets confused as hell and gives these warnings if it detects abnormal conditions. For me, that was the steering rack suddenly getting slammed into another universe and screwing with the alignment. 

Nothing to worry about if the codes go away and don't return. If they do, go get codes read and see what exactly is wrong. All of these systems run off of an intricate system of sensors of all kinds, and anything going wrong in that system can send these messages. 

Don't suddenly flip and start looking for parts to replace, google around and look on forums and see what they say. See if the codes come back, and if they do, see what exactly is wrong by going to an auto parts store that will read your diagnostic codes for you. If the warnings disappear and dont come back, that just means you lost traction bad enough to confuse the computer."
14,"If you scan or have the car scanned, it will give you something to help diagnose what is happening. Trying to guess what the issue is without a bit more info is tricky. It could be something as simple as low voltage, from the battery issue you mentioned, it could require the steering angle sensor to be recalibrated or it might be unrelated to the battery and just a faulty sensor."
15,"YEA,100 Percent no on a used engine that could still have an issue, Id see if ford could step in here. its a design defect even if the car is out of warranty. Im not judging your financial situation but can you afford the other option even?"
16,"Depends.

You gonna keep the vehicle? The used engine, if it?s not the updated short block, will have the same issue again. If you?re looking to ditch the car, a used engine would get it going so you could trade it off. It won?t add anything to the value, as at that point it?s just a mechanically regular vehicle.

A new short block would take care of the issue, and you?d be on the road again without having to worry about it again. If you go this route, I?d say to have them do the timing belt as well."
17,"An F-100 4x4 wasn't an F-180 or F-190, and an F-250 4x4 isn't an F-260.

As for value, a [1963 F-100 4x4](https://www.hagerty.com/valuation-tools/ford/f~100/1963/1963-ford-f~100-1!2_ton?id=aCn1I000000D4klSAC&search=q%3D1963%2520Ford%2520F-100%26year%3D1963%26bodyStyleConfig%3D2dr%2520Styleside%2520Long%2520Bed%25204x4%26p%3D1%26st%3Dymm) is worth less than $11,000 in that condition."
18,"If you have a mach e nobody thinks it's a mustang
If you have a v6 like me nobody thinks it's a mustang
If you have a i4 nobody thinks it's a mustang
If you drive a 3v everyone tells you to coyote swap it
If you drive a coyote everyone asks why u drive a mustang 

I fixed my car, it's blue and go vroom and I like it. 
All that matters is the one who owns it fucks with it"
19,"I drove a MachE in Phx AZ for a day and it was really nice. Tesla should be embarrassed. Because the MachE fit and finish was way nicer and it was really comfortable to drive. I never ""drove"" a Tesla, but was a passenger in one. It felt a bit cheap."
20,"Curious as to your problem. 

IF this is the center position seat, the belt and latch are connected to the 60% portion seat frame and not the cab. As long as the seat frame bolts are removed from the floor-to-bracket mount, that unit should be able to lift and remove."
21,"I'm a little pissed that the Mach-E isn't considered an SUV for the new tax credits.  Limiting the tax credits to < 55K MSRP means no extended range batter option can get it.    


And to see some of the others that are considered SUV (and not ""cars"") shows it's just arbitrary.  Frustrating.

EDIT:. It has been changed to qualify -- great news!"
22,"Fanboying is fun. I understand fanboying things. I even understand a mustang fanboy being upset about the Mach E because it's different than the things you love and made you a fan of mustangs.   


It's not okay to harass random people about it."
23,"The way I look at it is its the mustang family,  same as the bronco you get the bronco and bronco sport.... its a mach e but part of the mustang family.

And I'm a fan, sat in out and had a good look around etc ""not driven"" but yeah I liked it."
24,"Two things can be true at once. 

It?s a disgrace to the Mustang name, but it?s probably the best car I?ve ever had the pleasure to drive. 

I mean, it handles beautifully, looks beautiful, very comfortable, can feel sporty, and also tame, tons of tech, efficient, lots of cargo, among so many other things. Just because it isn?t a V8 manual gas guzzler, it doesn?t mean it?s a bad car"
25,I think a lot more people hate that it?s an SUV than the fact that it?s an EV. Imagine a mustang but just with an electric motor in it. Probaby wouldn?t cause as much backlash as completely changing the body style
26,"Every mustang has been hated on for something as well. I never understood car culture, i was in a Mustang club and I was unhappy. Going on cruises alone at 12am to 3am is much better than dealing with shit talking. When the coyote gets replaced theyll tell you swap it out just like their doing with 3vs. Both my 4.0 and 5.0 made me happy, I miss them."
27,"They're great cars but I have no clue why ford named it a mustang. Everything about it is completely different from what a mustang has ever been known as. Might as well rebrand the mustang a ford courier.  It just made no sense to me outside of attempting to attract people to the spirited nature of EV vehicles. Either way, sick car but should have left the mustang name out of it in my opinion."
28,"Not a Mustang, because Mustangs are coupes and convertibles not a crossover.

I can?t wait for a real EV Mustang.  

It?s got zero to do with the powertrain and everything to do with the actual Crossover not being a pony car."
29,"last i recall it was designed by employees who all owned a mustang

performs the same as the mustang

base is on par with the ecoboob

mid trim and up is on par with the coyote

can someone explain to me how its not a mustang?

""gen 1s were falcons, gen 2s were pintos, gen 3s were fairmonts and everything else foxbody, gen 4s were still foxbodies just patched more than unreal tournament, gen 5s or s197s were the closest thing to a one true mustang"" -RCR"
30,"I see a mustang I think ?That?s a nice mustang? 

I see a mach e I think ?What is this gabagool? 

Mach e is an electric suv. Kinda cool I suppose, but it?s not a mustang to me. 

But this is just my opinion, and you know what they say about opinions?"
31,"Here?s the best answer if your vehicle is less than 10 years old?

Seatbelt warranties from the manufacturer are 10 years. Most people aren?t aware of this. 

Take it to the dealership and get it fixed for FREE!"
32,"As a Tesla owner ppl just assume that I want to save the planet. Nope. I like stepping on the go pedal and making cars in my rear view mirror smaller.  Also I like plugging my car in at night because gas is expensive. 

I would really love android auto tho. If I were still on android."
33,"If you ever get the chance, the American Muscle Car Museum in Melbourne, Florida (about 45 mins from Disney) has an amazing collection of GTs. You walk in and immediately see 8 in a circle. It?s stunning."
34,Those flat style OEM splash guards are very cheap to begin with. In general splash guards are terrible in snow conditions especially slushy wet snow so it?s best to remove them during winter. They tend to catch all of it and it continually builds up until it makes contact with the wheel and eventually it?ll shake/break off and I?m not surprised it took the splash guard with it. They generally bend readily and a gap forms at the top for more snow to pack in and push outwards from the top. I have seen these issues happen before on mine and friends vehicles
35,"Haven't seen that yet. I have a 2020 Escape and the ""chrome metal"" sticker on the window rocker switches has peeled/flaked off by 10k miles. 

Thank God it's only a lease. I don't know if I want this car long term."
36,"Bought a brand new 2022 Escape Titanium Hybrid less than 4 months ago, the cheap plastic cant handle winter driving. One of the rear splash guard broke off and the second one is starting to get loose. The bolts holding it are in the same piece of plastic that runs under all the doors so I would need to change the entire thing. 

Am I the only one with this issue? 

Dealer says he never seen that issue ever and its not covered."
37,"If your car is under warranty, you are eligible for rental coverage. I believe it is $60/day up to a max of $2000. Paid through reimbursement, so receipts required. Overage requires corporate approval. Open a case with Ford customer care if you haven?t already. Issue must be diagnosed before you are eligible for the rental coverage. Good luck. I lived through this with a brand new car last fall."
38,"It?s automatic 4x4.  If you look at the rear axle you will see a differential and drive axles to the rear wheels.  

No idea why the light came on, though.  Perhaps it sensed a momentary problem but resolved itself."
39,"Max tow on a hybrid is 2k lbs and FWD. The Ecvt should hold up much better than a standard CVT. 

I owned one for about 12k miles(Loaded EB AWD). Keep in mind it is a cheap vehicle for a reason. It gets the job done but it's not built to the level of quality like a 150 or other flagship models. Even the BS is more refined. 

Also good luck getting one."
40,I should have a lock on one for msrp. Can?t wait to order one. I?m over waiting for a bronco build. Between this or a similar priced badlands bronco 4cyl. The ranger raptor seems to be winning in my mind.
41,"4.0L is not my favorite.  4.6l is the better Engine option.  Transmissions are not great, but not the worst I?ve seen either.  Check closely for how quickly it engages from drive to reverse.  Delays there are the beginning signs of a rebuild coming soon."
42,"I'm fairly certain this was staged.  Nobody gets hauled in for driving a non-street legal car on the road. It's more of a  ""we're gonna impound your shit, and here's a ticket with your court date, have a nice day.""  kind of thing.   And they wouldn't leave it in the middle of an intersection."
43,"Speaking from experience here, owned a 2012 EcoBoost that went 229,000 miles with minimal problems. 

Worry about previous maintenance and upkeep. Stay up on oil changes, I always used Ford oil and filters. Address small issues before they aren?t small anymore. Small coolant leaks are likely the turbo cooling lines, fix them if they occur, they can become problematic if ignored. Otherwise, drive and enjoy it."
44,"Honestly it?s not my cup of tea, it?s just a fancy truck, if I had money to blow sure I?d consider it but I?ll stick with my ranger for now, don?t need to do crazy heavy truck stuff and don?t need a pavement princess"
45,"Find out what your paint code is first, then search online for a replacement used bumper (breakers yard, scrapyard, ebay etc in your colour or get it sprayed your colour. Don't bother trying to repair the current 1 because it's made of plastic..it'll never look as good as a none damaged 1. They're easy to remove/refit..few screws and clips holding it on. Alternatively just leave it as is...it's not that bad tbh..nothing looks like it will fall off whilst driving.

I hope this helps you"
46,"That's a Ford...

Did you try punching it back in shape from the inside?

There should be plenty of room to do so from underneath.

If it pops back into shape with or without cracks you just need a paint job, some putty and the plastic or ornament.

Shouldn't cost much... the materials that is.

If it's extruded however and can't be popped back into place you may need a straight up new bumper.

Prices... depend on area. The materials to do it cost peanuts. The ""labor"" is usually a ripoff.

Repairing the bumper requires some mental effort. Most ""craftsmen"" today can not do that. Will probably recommend a new bumper regardless."
47,I did the Ford Racing Power Pack 2 on my GT (before doing long tubes and getting a proper dyno tune). [It doesn't void the powertrain warranty.](https://performanceparts.ford.com/download/PDFS/fpp-warranty.pdf)
48,"I disagree that the ecoboosts are all junk. All engines have their issues, and when there are a couple million examples on the road a very small failure rate will affect a lot of vehicles.

That being said, the 1.0 is not a good engine. The timing belt is oil soaked, idk why, all other eco's are chains. when the belt fails it clogs the oil pump as well, so a failed belt usually means you need a new engine."
49,"If the car was about 750 pounds lighter it wouldn?t be too bad. However, the ecosport is a fat pig in comparison to the tiny engine, that?s why it doesn?t get great mpg. 29 mpg highway is laughable for a little car. But the market demanded AWD and a higher seating position, bumping the weight. Too much strain on such small displacement. It?ll be the kind of car that totally disappears from roads in 5-7 years. 


A Focus hatch with a manual gearbox would be the move if you want a used Blue Oval in that same vain."
50,It?ll take a lot more R&D before a super duty goes fully electric. Take a look at any clickbaity YouTube video about how the lightning sucks at towing. Tons of people out there need to move 10-20k pounds frequently and with ease
51,"Depends on how far in the future you're looking. 

I think you'll still be able to buy non-evs from Ford for another 10-15 years. Somewhere around that point they'll finish their transition to being EV-only."
52,"Ford senior master tech here.  I worked at a dealer that serviced several limo companies and their Navs had 100-200k on original engine, trans, differentials etc. I'm not gonna comment on price but the mileage would not scare me off, if it was well maintained. I agree with others that a loaded expedition is a better value."
53,"I got a 2018 Lincoln Mkz hybrid reserve with <40K miles on it for $28,995

I know SUV?s are more expensive than sedans, but seeing as how they?re both Lincoln?s, both same year, (and I assume your trim is around a reserve) I personally wouldn?t pay 45k for this many miles. 

If they were asking high 30?s like $38k or so then yes."
54,"2.7l or 3.5l? 
 

3.5l is known for cam phaser rattle. 
2 7l is known for plastic oil pan. 

Imo get a catch can installed and be on top of oil changes, use sn plus full synthetic oil, never use high ethanol gas, try to get 93 octane as well."
55,"It?s probably a lease return. When I see aftermarket wheels shod in the cheapest possible off-brand rubber it leads me to believe that this vehicle was probably not maintained to the standard required of a luxury vehicle.

I personally wouldn?t buy a used luxury SUV. Lots of things want to break after 5 years."
56,"From my personal experience, my mother in law bought a 2018 and it has been in the dealership countless times. The sunroof doesnt work, there was a coolant leak they just ""couldnt"" find, and the power running boards stop working often. Obviously not the case for every one, but it was the same model year you are looking at."
57,"75k miles on a nav isn?t even broken in. These are 300k mile chassis, we have two ecoboosts with almost 400k combined miles. 

In 2020 we paid $40k for our 2017 with 49k miles at the time. It is a reserve L loaded, for reference purposes."
58,"To me, it depends a lot on how aggressively you can pay it off. Can you pay for it immediately, or within the next 3 years?

My concern is that if you have to finance it for longer than that, then you'll be making payments when the vehicle is 10 years old and some of those luxury electronics are likely to need help, and other long-term maintenance and repair items will be rearing their ugly head. It's hard to keep a car looking and working like new when it's 10 years old, and personally I want my vehicles to seem like new if I'm making payments. 

I think you'd be a lot better off buying a new $50k vehicle if you have to finance for more than 3 years."
59,"Ehhhhh. Maybe. What trim level? Ask for the Carfax. Any accidents or lack of maintenance would be an automatic no for me. People that buy these new typically aren?t people who do their own service, so if there is a lack of records there?s likely a lack of service. Even with a perfect Carfax I?d probably offer in the high 30s and try to negotiate a little. The art of negotiating is slowly being lost though, lol. Salesman acted like I was crazy when I started negotiating on our Explorer last year."
60,"If you are paying cash and want a Lincoln, go for it.  If you are financing I would stay away. Any car with 45K miles is going to start needing maintenance and parts replaced. Can you afford expensive maintenance and car payments, if yes.. go for it. If not, I would suggest buying something less prestigous that is new or lower milaege. If you want new, you can buy a Corsair for that kind of money. As far as quality of Explorers, I have a 21 and its a wonderful car."
61,"I wouldn?t make a vehicle purchase now if I can wait, everything was and is hugely inflated, used car inventories are building, I see use car lots filling. Wait it out and as they get desperate price will drop and will help
Ease inflation."
62,"I got a 2018 and drove it from 30k to 60k bought it at 30k for $43k off lease.  I got a serious deal.  I just got it back from the dealership for wheel hubs and wheel bearing they changed it out on warranty.  I have warranty up to 100k and if I keep the car going to the dealership for oil changes and service I'll have a lifetime drivetrain warranty.   I did have a heater hose go out which was 5 hours of labor and about $350 in parts.  I'm calling lincoln service to be like come on and they usually help out.  So far the vehicle has really be mostly trouble free and looking gorgeous people always complement me and I always keep it looking clean.  No stickers or anything just well waxed and washed all the time.  it's a dream to drive and great to load people up and go somewhere.  Ask me any questions and I'll be happy to answer.  Mine has power running boards, it's the select version with 4x4 I really love it.  Black gloss and dang it's fast as hell.  Everyone that sees it is jealous."
63,"The 1.5 EB from that time has issues with coolant entering the combustion chamber, due to the open deck design and therefore the head gasket being too thin in between the cylinders. Engines built after April 2019 are fixed. But before that, I'd stay away from it."
64,"Good morning, everyone!

Hope you all have a fantastic week! We are eager for the spring season and so was one of our clients who was looking to upgrade his Tremor before moving to the west coast.

65,"I work at a dealership in the service area and we've had tons of this happen. I have an engine on order for over 4 months now. They are so back ordered on parts not even Ford knows when they'll get them to you. It's frustrating for everyone involved for sure. Sadly, this isn't much help to you directly but you're definitely not the only one having to deal with it right now"
66,If you're going to be dumb you might as well go all the way and use a 6.2 liter. Outside dimensions and over all cost is basically the same regardless of the engine you choose as they do use interchangable parts.
67,Yep! Any Ford with remote start through Ford Pass should work although mine didn?t work at first and randomly it started. I use a Siri shortcut I found over on /r/Shortcuts  which is much more reliable IMO and can be done with voice commands or a complication on the watch face itself.
68,"Can confirm edge will cease production later this year, or early 2024, as ill be laid off when that happens. Rumor is we will be getting BEV explorer/navigator. But no truth to the rumors as of yet. All Edge production will be shifted to China for the Chinese market edges."

70,"I'm not really sure if he talked about Chakra, but the fact that he was a celebate all his life must certainly mean that he had some knowledge about the subject. I'll post a link here in reply where he talks about diverting sexual energy to use it for a greater purpose. All who know about Tesla also know that he had made predictions about the future which indicates clairvoyance. 

According to tantric philosophy, preserving sperm, not only preserving sperm but avoiding any sexual thoughts increase your life force / auro which in turn aids you greatly in awakening Kundalini. Which is definitely related to Chakra.  "
71,"Omg, what, no.  Chakra wasn't an even remotely familiar concept at the time.  Tesla was bold in his claims, loved dangerous amounts of electrical power and was able to make some impressive claims, but he didn't get into the realm of health, body, biology or any of that.  He was more of an inventor, for practical, functional, problem solving."
72,"As far as I've read, Tesla did not likely believe in chakras. While he was familiar with Eastern religions more so in than the common man (I believe he mentions Buddhism in ""My Inventions"") he was generally apathetic in speaking on the subject. Perhaps your friend may be interpreting this statement from his final interview with ""The New Yorker"".

> ""Everyone must have ideals. If they do not...."" He shook his head in despair, then went on to talk about religion. ""Religion,"" he said, ""is simply an ideal. It is an ideal force that tends to free the human being from material bonds. I do not believe that matter and energy are interchangeable, any more than are the body and soul. There is just so much matter in the universe and it cannot be destroyed. As I see life on this planet, there is no individuality. It may sound ridiculous to say so, but I believe each person is but a wave passing through space, ever-changing from minute to minute as it travels along, finally, some day, just becoming dissolved.""

He was much more scientific about his views, implying God may be a more fundamental nature of particle behavior and matter than a person. Perhaps this can be interpreted as chakras, but I doubt she was going through all his individual interviews to find the needle in the haystack. Tesla rarely spoke on religion. He came across uncomfortable with the subject, focusing more so on philosophy and moral than any particular religion. This has led some to believe he's closeted atheist, or at least agnostic.

What more likely happened was your friend read about the 'Tesla purple plates' or saw a few Pinterest post [like this one](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/8d/9b/b7/8d9bb794619c70ff5467869083aca6c8.jpg). They're total bullshit and have nothing to do with Tesla besides superficial similarities.

73,">A little over one century ago many astronomers, including Laplace still thought that the system of heavenly bodies was unalterable and that they would perform their motions in the same manner through an eternity. But the gradual perfection of instruments and refinement of methods of investigation, achieved since that time, has led to the recognition that there is a continuous change going on in the celestial regions subjecting all bodies to ever varying influence. Where this change is leading to, and what is to be its final phase, have become questions of supreme scientific interest. ...Lord Kelvin drew attention to the general tendency in nature towards dissipation of mechanical energy, a fact borne out in daily observation of thermo-dynamic and dynamo-thermic processes and one of ominous significance. [[heat/entropic death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe)] It meant that the driving force of the universe was steadily decreasing and that ultimately all of its motive energy will be exhausted none remaining available for mechanical work. In the macro-cosmos, with its countless conception, this process might require billion of years for its consummation; but in the infinitesimal worlds of the micro-cosmos it must have been quickly completed. Such being the case then, according to an experimental findings and deductions of positive science, any material substance (cooled down to the absolute zero of temperature) should be devoid of any internal movement and energy, so to speak, dead.

>This idea of the great philosopher, who later honored me with his friendship, had a fascinating effect on my mind and in meditating over it I was struck by the thought that if there is energy within the substance it can only come from without. This truth was so manifest to me that I expressed it in the following axiom: ""There is no energy in matter except that absorbed from the medium."" Lord Kelvin gave us a picture of a dying universe, of a clockwork wound up and running down, inevitably doomed to come to a full stop in the far, far off future. It was a gloomy view incompatible with artistic, scientific and mechanical sense. I asked myself again and again, was there not some force winding up the clock as it runs down? The axiom I had formulated gave me a clue. If all energy is supplied to matter from without then this all important function must be performed by the medium. Yes?but how?

>I pondered over this oldest and greatest of all riddles of physical science a long time in vain, despairingly reminded of the words of the poet:  
*Wo fass ich dich unendliche Natur?*  
*Euch Bruste wo Ihr Quellen alles Lebens*

>*Where, boundless nature, can I hold you fast?*

Instead he considered radioactivity to be caused by some ubiquitous subtle radiation he identified, which he considered responsible for what was subsequently determined to be the supposed potential energy of matter. I wonder to what extent Tesla's ideas influenced Nernst in postulating zero-point energy in 1916, around 20 years after Tesla initially formulated his theories. Tesla's theories from the 1890s could be the original inspiration for Nernst, Dirac and others' theories about ubiquitous energy.

As I've mentioned before, Hermann Plauson's 1920s energy balloons look identical to Tesla's radio balloons from the 1890s. Plauson's patent also demonstrated how to use a Nernst glow bar lamp as a triode amplifier, which seems like it must have originally been Tesla's idea. Tesla was also the real inventor of the vacuum triode amplifier that Lee De Forest received credit for. As Tesla [explained in the 1930s](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1932-09-11.htm), he experimented with triodes in the 1890s, more than a decade before De Forest. Tesla used triode amplification on a completely different scale than the little thermionic vacuum tube though. His long range power transmitter apparently used triode amplification over tens of meters for the towers and up to 1-3 kilometers with balloons. Maybe Tesla intended to patent his form of triode amplifier more surreptitiously by incorporating it into his 1902 [magnifying transmitter patent](https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/patents/us-patent-1119732-apparatus-transmitting-electrical-energy).

It's hard to imagine how Nernst's zero-point energy might be harnessed, but here are some possibilities. First considering the concept of Tesla's ubiquitous radiation as being like other radiation, as Paul Brown demonstrated in the 1980s and '90s, [a resonant transformer (Tesla coil) can be used to harness particle energy](http://i.imgur.com/mZDRu1Q.jpg) from radioactivity. Brown was licensed to handle moderately high energy radioactive materials and tested many materials as particle energy sources. That seems awfully dangerous, dirty and unnecessary though, because a Tesla x-ray/electron tube could probably provide the requisite particle energy without any of the tremendous drawbacks of radioactive materials. Maybe zero-point energy could be invoked to explain how this device works, where the energy comes from. As Tesla mentioned in his 1891-1893 lectures, an arc gap inside a capacitor might do something unexpected especially with relativistic electrons like Tesla described in his mid-1890s letters to technical periodicals about x-rays. Tesla patented the idea of charging a unipolar capacitor with x-rays [in 1901](https://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/patents/us-patent-685957-apparatus-utilization-radiant-energy). In this way, [Tesla/Hettinger plasma column antennas](https://www.google.com/patents/US1309031) might have been generating power rather t"
75,"Tesla met Edison in 1884, when he came to New York to work for him after having previously worked for his French subsidiary for the previous year or two. Tesla was hopeful Edison would be interested in developing his AC motor, which he had not yet been able to patent, but he was disappointed when no one with Edison was interested. After the ""practical joke"" about a large payment for redesigning a bunch of motors and generators less than a year after he started, Tesla quit.

Sometime after 1888, Tesla relinquished hundreds of millions of dollars in promised royalties in order to give Westinghouse a better chance to succeed financially ($2.50/horse power!). The joke was probably on Tesla if he thought Edison and Westinghouse were really such different companies that it mattered which he helped. In fact they both had the same primary investors, so that their competition was pointless waste from their investors' perspective. The two companies were probably only maintained instead of conglomerated in order to provide some degree of competition and more importantly the appearance of competition. 

Westinghouse recently filed for bankruptcy. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/westinghouse-toshiba-nuclear-bankruptcy.html

For a while I thought O'Neill's biography was the only source that said $50,000, which made me doubt it was really that much money, but when I saw Tesla's autobiography said the same amount, I realized I was wrong to have doubted O'Neill about it.

Tesla must have been excited when he thought he would be making that money because it would be enough to develop his motors and power distribution system as well as the arc lights he was developing, which must have made the realization it was a ""joke"" all the more disappointing.

Elihu Thomson who took over Edison's electric company in 1892 would take credit for the Tesla coil with a resonant circuit magnetic interrupter the same year ([US 500,630](https://www.google.com/patents/US500630)) even though he patented the year after Tesla's first public demonstrations that included that idea. Unfortunately many sources from the time would refer to the Tesla coil as the Tesla-Thomson coil. Thomson also wouldn't credit Tesla for originating the magnetic circuit breaker concept that he subsequently developed as a useful safety device that would be popular until the cheaper thermally actuated contemporary circuit breaker was introduced decades later. Thomson also reappropriated his triipolar x-ray tube from Tesla. Tesla didn't care as much as he might have because the tripolar tube was vastly inferior to the unipolar tube. Thomson also took credit for Tesla's voltage multiplier concept. John Trowbridge is also sometimes credited with originating the HV voltage multiplier concept in some textbooks. While Tesla used his voltage multiplier concept with a rotary spark gap to produce continuous waves up to around ELF range. Trowbridge was using lever-actuated switches to produce only one individua"
76,"It turns out J J Thomson stole the discovery of the electron and the definition of the quantum from Tesla. Tesla, as a lowly electrical engineer, had submitted his findings for peer review to Professor J J Thomson, a world renowned, brilliant, doctorate in Physics, a new way to describe the world and the universe.  Thomson returned Tesla's findings and told him they were ridiculous, that the electron was a packet of energy was nonsense. Tesla went into a Twitter-fit on the New York Times and Thomson engaged with return letters. Thomson then broke off all contact with Tesla, notifying the Ivory Tower of Physics that he had confirmed Mr. Tesla was nothing but a crackpot. Six years later, Thomson made the global announcement he had discovered the electron and the quantum concept, leading to a whole new area, of quantum physics. Trying to get copies of all the letters, Mr. Tesla goes into quite a bit more detail than his press interviews.  Mr. Tesla was the discoverer of the electron and the quantum, not Professor J J Thomson."
77,"Here is a contemporary patent for ionospheric energy harvesting.

This patent explains one major problem with ionospheric energy harvesting using a simple plasma conductor is that the plasma current interrupts itself by Z-pinch, and the interrupted current can cause random lightning strikes. This method avoids that problem by using a plasma tube created by an array of high power lasers. The tube can carry the current without pinching immediately, or more importantly, without breaking up causing random lightning. 

The patent says the power pulse received is greater than lightning, which creates a lot of engineering challenges to handle the current and heat. 

He describes his laser array plasma tube projector in some of his other patents.

---

There are more problems complicating the use of this system than those acknowledged in the patent. Besides the extreme electric current and extreme heat mentioned in the patent, the toxic radio-dust of the stratosphere may present a problem for this. The use of this type of energy harvesting anywhere outside the arctic and antarctic circles might cause problem with the weather or even interfere with atmospheric circulation. Inventor Jules Guillot said if atmospheric energy is collected near the ground, it should be collected in a particular way to avoid interfering with atmospheric circulation. He used a vertical negative collector and a positive collector pointed north or south, whichever is toward the equator, and it was apparently high frequency energy with an electrostatic bias from a combination of points, coils and magnets. 

I talk about unforeseen problems with atmospheric energy harvesting a lot, but there are a couple of unexpected benefits possible too. Extracting electrostatic energy from the atmosphere suppresses hail and destructive weather in general. Removing the toxic stratospheric dust so it cannot harm people or animals may improve the quality of life for people and all life on earth. 

I thought about collecting the dust with collectors based on the ground or in space, but the dust is actually useful where it is for providing some shade. Removing it increasing global warming. 

There might be a better way to keep it out of the troposphere. The troposphere is the atmosphere up to ~11 km where almost all the air is. Above the troposphere is the much lighter stratosphere. 

Ozone layer electrification could keep the dust out of the troposphere and enlarge the ozone layer at the same time. This could be possible by increasing the positive charge of the ozone layer so it repels the positive dust falling from the stratosphere above it. Is that rational? This might cause the dust to accumulate in the lower layer of the ionosphere where it would dim the sun. Charging the ozone layer should make the sky bluer, which sounds nice. And reducing the UV light by expanding the ozone layer should be healthy in addition to the health benefit in repelling stratospheric dust.

79,">Disclosed are various embodiments for transmitting energy conveyed in the form of a guided surface-waveguide mode along the surface of a terrestrial medium by exciting a polyphase waveguide probe.

This is a really interesting patent. The text describes use with LF-MF-HF-VHF band waves (100 kHz to 60 MHz). In one example at 59 MHz at 100 km, the received signal was 2 uV/m for the standard Norton surface wave compared to 2 mV/m with guided surface waves, which is 1000 times stronger. 

As I've mentioned before, this guided surface wave ""radio"" concept explains why Tesla used spherical and other unusually round ""antennas"" instead of normal antenna shapes. Tesla's ""antennas"" are actually waveguide probes for non-radiated guided waves. Waveguide probes launch guided surface/evanescent waves. Antennas radiate free/unguided/Hertz waves.

Looking back at historical sources, Zenneck (1915) distinguished between the space wave (Hertz component) and surface/conduction component (later termed Zenneck surface wave) writing [transmitted radio waves became surface waves with distance as surface waves suffer less attenuation](https://books.google.com/books?id=0DFLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA249), but he doesn't seem to have been aware of the difference between radio antennas and waveguide probes, which is strange. Tesla was both aware of the distinction and strongly favored using surface waves and waveguide probes already by 1899, which is why it might make more sense to refer to them as Tesla surface waves instead of Zenneck.

^* The signal being 30 dB stronger isn't where the greatest advantage in using guided surface waves comes from though, it's because with this method, the transmitted energy can be conserved. The energy is not necessarily irretrievably lost but for a tiny minuscule useful for signaling as it is with radiated waves. In order to be conserved, the transmission has to overcome losses first, which are not insignificant but surprisingly low. Tesla said it only took 2-3 KW to establish global resonance. That would presumably depend on the number of ionizing points though (like especially lightning rods or modern dissipation arrays), so losses today should be higher than they were around 1900. But if long range wireless power became popular, ionizing points would slowly be replaced to conserve power. Tesla's ellipsoidal lightning protectors or metal balloons could be used to receive power while also protecting from lightning."
80,"Basically, Tesla is describing how he used the earth as an antenna, and set up a standing wave in the earth, from his position to the position on the exact opposite side.


Thus his signal would be receivable from anywhere on earth.


He assumed his signal was traveling along the surface of the earth, and knowing the circumference, calculated the velocity based on the travel time and the circumference. 


The pertinent paragraph is thus:


> Third. The most essential requirement is, however, that, irrespective of frequency, the wave or wave-train should continue for a certain interval of time, which I have estimated to be not less than one-twelfth or probably 0.08484 of a second and which is taken in passing to and returning from the region diametrically opposite the pole over the earths surface with a mean velocity of about four hundred and seventy-one thousand two hundred and forty kilometers per second. 


His mistake was that he believed his wave was traveling along the surface.

Interestingly: 471240/(PI/2)=300000.70153

Obviously 300000 km/s is pretty close to the speed of light.

He also mentions 0.08484 seconds as the time it takes it to pass to the opposite side and back.

Interestingly: 0.08484 seconds * 300000 km/s = 25452 kilometers, which is close to twice the diameter of the earth.
(Twice the diameter of earth is 25484km)

I consider it quite reasonable to assume that he had incorrectly assumed his standing waves were on the surface, but that in reality they were straight through, and that they were just going the speed of radiowaves in a very low impedance conductor called the earth."
81,"This is from Tesla's [1916 legal brief](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/nt_on_ac.htm) compiled by Leland Anderson in 1992. It's captioned: ""Figure 5. Illustrating various ways of using a high frequency alternator in the first experiments at the Grand Street Laboratory: 1891-1893."" 

The generator/dynamo symbols refer to his 1890 RF alternators capable of producing VLF (up to ~30 kHz) at up to 25 KW with cooling ([447,920](http://www.google.com/patents/US447920), [447,921](https://www.google.com/patents/US447921)). Besides those alternators he patented, he mentioned building more experimental ones for higher frequencies but only at much low power. 

On the great advance in two-circuit transmission (the transmission half of the four-circuit radio concept), Tesla said,

>Now, I found that notwithstanding I tuned this system successfully [circuit 3, single circuit transmitter], I could not get this antenna or these ""cans,"" as we called them at that time, charged sufficiently high. But it occurred to me that if I transformed the current and raised the tension of the dynamo in a transformer, I could then charge the antenna to a higher potential and produce a greater displacement of electricity. That resulted in an arrangement like this [Diag. 4 of Fig. 5], in which I have the dynamo supply a primary coil, generate a second current of higher potential, and tune the secondary and adjust the conditions so that this conductor [connecting the antenna to the transformer], including the secondary of the coil, is again tuned to the frequency of the dynamo. That was a fine advance; it is the one step that today is absolutely essential, because only in the fewest instances can the power of a generator be taken up without transformation.

These were the first radio transmitter circuits using two or more tuned circuits. Tesla developed them years before Marconi and Lodge started experimenting with radio, but that wouldn't stop them and Braun from claiming to have invented the concept before Tesla.

As other radio experts of the time would only rarely admit publicly, Marconi's claim to inventing radio was basically a patent trolling scam trying to ""get a monopoly on wireless"" ([Marriott, 1925](http://www.coutant.org/radiogrow/)). Marconi's skill was as a promoter and salesman rather than as an inventor or scientist. His successful monopolization of radio patents delayed the development of radio technology at least a decade with lawsuits, royalties demanded from other manufacturers ([even amateurs](https://books.google.com/books?id=aXtQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA773)) and by wasting all the enormous investment that might have been invested in better radio companies. For example, John Stone Stone's radio company went out of business even though he was the first to introduce four-circuit radio after Tesla. He was the other guy that the Supreme Court credited with having patented four-circuit radio (i.e., practical rather than Hertz/Dolbear/Hughes experimental short range radio) afte"

As this link references, in her biography *Tesla: Man Out of Time*, Margaret Cheney claimed Tesla was antisemitic saying he made an antisemitic comment to a secretary once. There doesn't appear to be any corroborating evidence of Tesla having any prejudice against Jewish people though with the small exception of Tesla making the offhand remark about Jewish people being part of a bad day in a context that suggests humor, irony or potentially even referencing someone else's joke obliquely. Tesla's secretary, George Scherff once made a very mild antisemitic joke in a telegram to Tesla apparently referencing Jewish lawyers being associated with charging high prices in relating Tesla's new Jewish lawyer required a prepaid retainer.

Unlike many American businessmen of the 1930s, Tesla never said anything positive about Hitler. And he obviously didn't trust him as he is known to have felt compelled to try to help defend nations threatened by the new European fascist dictatorships by getting them to develop and install his defensive directed energy weapon concept.

Tesla was unfortunately friends with poet George Sylvester Viereck, a Nazi propagandist, which might speak to his poor ability to judge character. His business history would appear to speak to his poor ability to judge character too. In his business dealings, Tesla put too much faith in people he shouldn't have trusted. It was probably the biggest reason he was not more successful despite ideas at least 10 years ahead of others. 

Tesla could have had some business conflicts with Jewish people. The incidents of [the Marconi Scandal](http://www.counter-currents.com/2016/03/the-marconi-scandal/) insider trading incident revealed that Marconi's British investors included certain British Jewish politicians. For comparison though, Tesla had been slighted considerably more by the German patent office, who rejected his patents for all his big inventions including AC motors, polyphase and radio.

Tesla supported King Peter II's claim to rule whose resistance to Hitler cost Yugoslavia dearly in 1941. Hitler slaughtered tens of thousands of civilians in retribution.

To return to the stupid anti-immigrant sentiments in the US lately if only for a moment, Tesla provides a superlative example of the benefits of immigration. He had been burglarized in his travels, so he arrived in the United States practically penniless and with an initially weak command of English, and look at all he gave the country. Anti-immigrant sentiment doesn't make any sense in a country made up of almost entirely immigrants like the US is.

86,"That is a very cool copy of an original newspaper article.  
  
All Tesla was saying about his long distance transmission system was that the Earth has a voltage as a function of height. A multimeter ground probe can be stuck in the ground, the positive probe on a very thin, low resistance wire, raised up into the air with a balloon and it would read a DC voltage that keeps going up with altitude. This is what powers lightning. Tesla's explanation of how he was harnessing this power was what Einstein rejected, blacklisted him from the physics community and ultimately, to cause JP Morgan to withdraw his financing.  
  
What Tesla said isn't that hard to understand. The natural Earth voltage is DC, he merely caused the Earth electric field to oscillate. If anybody ever gets anything about Tesla, he was all about vibration, oscillation and resonance. His Tesla coils discharged large sparks that appear to be lightning but lightning is DC. Tesla was using AC as a pump to cause the Earth's natural static voltage to oscillate, in 3-dimensional waves. He talked about the range, 12,000 miles because that was the length of the standing wave he was producing. 
  
The other thing to remember is that Tesla decided his wireless transmission system was obsolete and unnecessary after Wardenclyffe. We may never know what the replacement was, although he left hints in his patents like the patent for the Self-Exciting Dynamo.

87,"Tesla was essentially written out of history, which you suggest was intentional for his communist sympathies, but even worse for his reputation, he was friends with poet George Sylvester Viereck, a Nazi propagandist. Tesla appears to have opposed both fascism and communism, but fascism more than communism because, when he tried to help states threatened by fascists by arming them with defensive directed energy weapons, he included Lenin's Russia. Tesla pointed to the lack of freedom in Russia as terrible, and the reason he wouldn't want to move there despite persuasive offers to. When a reporter jokingly asked Tesla if he had a cure for Bolshevism in 1919, he said it wasn't necessary because Bolshevism was due to a lack of [""horse sense.""](http://www.teslacollection.com/tesla_articles/1919/new_york_telegram/ruth_raphael/world_fed_by_electricity_to_defeat_high_living_cost) He would probably have been disappointed to learn of Yugoslavia's communism, but it's not like the monarchy seems like it was worth preserving. 

Was Tesla's erasure necessarily sinister though? It could have just been the natural conflict with other corporate and personal interests, which is normal in business. Tesla invented a lot of things that other people and powerful companies claimed credit for originating. And besides that, Tesla, Plauson, Stubblefield and others working along the same lines determined how to harness various natural power sources (geomagnetic/geoelectric waves/disturbances, cosmic rays, NORM, lightning, narrow bipolar pulses, etc.) using simple radio equipment often with unusual aerials or grounding. A lot of industries would be interested in that being forgotten.

Erasing Tesla didn't start in 1950. It started with each invention that others took credit for. That started even during his initial rise in the 1890s. Among others Oudin, Seibt, Elihu Thomson, Pupin, Marconi, Lodge and De Forest all took certain famous ideas from Tesla. People like Kinraide and Plauson took credit for others, or they might have purchased them or been given them fairly for all we know. Marconi took credit through newspaper publicity and also by publishing periodicals and textbooks. Tesla was generally too modest. He didn't promote many of his revolutionary inventions. For instance, he never so much as mentioned cavity resonance. He just used it. [Tesla incorporated a cavity resonator into the design of Wardenclyffe](http://www.emo.org.tr/ekler/8f44142913d7d06_ek.pdf#page=31) as a [smooth metal collar between the cupola and structure beneath it](https://www.teslauniverse.com/sites/default/files/images/tower_illustration_1.jpg), and he probably used the concept a lot of other places too.

The real story is he wrote to Thomson about his findings and Thomson responded that was ridiculous. This started a round of letters to the New York newspaper. Eventually, Thomson brushed him off, then 6 years later claimed he discovered the electron. In his letters, Tesla appears to theorize subatomic quanta. That would be something, to get all those letters together in one book, he wrote to the New York Times almost like it was Twitter.

When Nikola Tesla discovered the electron, one of the most important discoveries in the history of science , he wrote to J.J. Thomson in 1891 saying his experiments prove the existence of charged particles. J.J. Thomson reacted to Tesla's paper with his own article  claiming that such effects can be achieved even without the effect of electrostatics. Tesla responded with an article to J.J. Thomson's  in which he argued Thomson's claim, pointing out the significance of the effects of electrostatics. He clearly stated that the observed phenomenon is the result of ?small, charged particles? moving at high velocity and colliding with molecules of rarefied gas. In other words, Tesla was clearly claiming that his experiment proved the existence of charged particles, while J.J. Thomson disputed this. Until 1897, scientists believed atoms were indivisible, the ultimate particles of matter. Tesla even talked about experiments that suggested particles with fractional charges of an electron - something that scientists in 1977 finally discovered - quarks! Five years later Thomson conducted a different experiment and also proved the existence of electrons.Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the electron and his work on the conduction of electricity in gases.

89,"This is an old mail transport system. The patent called the general concept an electro-port. Today we would call it a linear motor. 

It looks like it would work a lot better than a pneumatic tube system. The wheels aren't motorized. They spin freely. The carriage is accelerated by coils in the track and the carriage. The wheels and track probably work better and use material better than the mica disc and tube described in the first patent, which was probably prone to jamming. From the first patent, he also included the possibility of using a track too. 

The only apparent connection to Tesla is the electromagnet in 1895, which is a form of Tesla's electromagnet. And Williams uses it the same way Tesla did, to neutralize the impedance of the inductor. That is a very strong connection. This might all have been Tesla's idea since the first patent in 1886. Maybe he sold the idea to Williams for a stake in the companies. I wonder how far they were able to develop this and why it failed if not for the most likely need for more capital than they were able to raise. 

Someone posted these woodcut illustrations to r/retrofuturism. The image database they're from doesn't say what they are or where they're from and only refers to them as monorails. I recognized the resemblance to Williams's electro-port, but I wasn't sure until I noticed the company name on the building, New England Port Electric Co., which would be the name he would use for a regional company. 

This linear motor concept appeared in many forms as hypothetical devices on Hugo Gernsback magazine cover art. 

---

This idea could work much better than it seems like it would. Tesla patented his electromagnet to neutralize impedance, which is what Williams patented the solenoidal form for too, but it can do more than that. It exhibits transmission line resonance rather than merely the simpler resonance of a discrete inductor. It exhibits transmission line resonance by virtue of its distributed capacitance. And then more importantly, it can apparently effectively violate Lenz's Law by the way the coil interacts with magnetic flux. With a simple inductor, the flux of the rotor counteracts the current with counter-current and the flux of the counter-current decelerates the rotor, which is how Lenz's Law occurs. Using one wire of the Tesla electromagnet as a stator inductor of a motor, the counter-current induced by the flux of the rotor occurs in the alternate winding, where it doesn't oppose the primary current. That effectively violates Lenz's Law as it is normally assumed to act (i.e., against the primary current). It's not violating Lenz's Law technically, but it is violating the oversimplified way that we normally consider it. Someone applied to patent that use for the Tesla stator in a permanent magnet generator: [US20140111054A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140111054A1). I'm oversimplifying this too much.

Tesla first demonstrated and popularized this hair raising spectacle in the 1890s, 40 years before Van de Graaff invented his static generator in 1935. It's interesting that now we associate hair raising with Van de Graaff when Van de Graaff himself associated it with Tesla. Tesla's was a lot more dramatic. How was it overshadowed?

Speaking of the Van de Graaff generator, [Tesla had suggested the possibilities of a silk belt electrostatic generator by 1915](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1915-09-09.htm). Tesla actually speculated various ancient civilizations might have used it for unknown purposes.

Why has this not been photographed more recently? Is it unphotographable? This image is actually supposedly a reproduction of a photograph like other photos in Gernsback's pulp magazine, but for some reason it looks more like an illustration than a photo. The glow and corona probably make photos blurry, which might also help explain how this spectacle's been forgotten today.

This is essentially like standing on a platform powered by a dangerously high power longwave radio transmitter, isn't it? Would it cause radio interference? Did someone eventually realize it's unhealthy?

I would guess it's likely been deemed unhealthy since the 19th century considering contemporary Tesla coil builders safety information says that in the past, they mistakenly assumed the skin effect would make RF currents harmless, but eventually it was determined that actually only applies to conductive metals rather than animals like people. In Gernsback's article, he mentions not being permitted to attempt the feat with the equipment on high power like Tesla would have.

92,">According to Maxwell's theory, the displacement current in vacuum can produce electromotive force on conducting current. However, the displacement current in vacuum does not experience electromotive force from conducting current. The asymmetrical electromotive forces result in non-conserved energy transmission between any two coils involving displacement current and conducting current. In this work, we designed and performed the measurements for such effect. We observed the explicit evidences of non-conserved energy transmission between a toroid solenoid and a parallel plate capacitor. The measured energy increase is well predicted by the numerical estimation.  
James C. Maxwell introduced the concept of displacement current in 1861. He did not realize that the displacement current can result in energy non-conservation (ENC) in electromagnetic interaction. A typical example is the interactions between a toroidal solenoid and a parallel plate capacitor. As shown in Fig. 1, a parallel plate capacitor connecting in a wire loop is placed in the middle of a toroidal solenoid. Both of them carry alternating currents. The conducting current Ic in the wire and the displacement current Id between the plates compose a closed current loop. Since this loop does not turn around the toroidal solenoid,  the alternating current Ic and Id cannot generate electromotive force (EMF) on the toroidal solenoid. On the other hand, the alternating current Is in the toroidal solenoid cannot generate electromotive force on any closed conducting loop which does not turn around the toroidal solenoid. However, the capacitor circuit is not a closed conducting loop because of the gap between the plates. The total electromotive force along the capacitor circuit equals to the integral of the electromotive force along the gap, which is not zero. In this case, the electromotive forces between the toroidal solenoid and the parallel plate capacitor are not equal. The current in the capacitor circuit can be pumped by the electromotive force from the toroidal solenoid. In the mean time, the capacitor circuit cannot pump the current in the toroidal solenoid. Therefore, the energy in this system is not conserved.

This looks interesting.

It appears Tesla used a similar sort of inductor-capacitor arrangement in the intermediate Tesla coil in [US Patent No. 593,138](http://www.google.com/patents/US593138), which was his [1897 x-ray tube driver coil](http://imgur.com/a/Y9muN) that featured the parasitic capacitance between the output terminals positioned in the center of the field of the primary and between the secondaries, with each secondary and its terminal, and possibly again with the parasitic capacitance between the output leads and the secondaries to which they were connected and through which they passed. Those first two parasitic capacitors are like this study about an inductor inside a parallel plate capacitor except the capacitor's inside the inductor in the first case and adja"
93,"This essay was regarded by many at the time as too long and philosophical and the connections between philosophical and scientific concepts at points (like where this link starts in the essay) were considered strange. To list a few of the more incredible ideas, he mentioned his opinion that a being who could create as easily as destroy would be like a god. He predicted mech wars saying war would have to become a competition of machines to eliminate the tragic destruction of human life in war. He considered the human body a beautiful machine. He kept returning to military robots and their ability to spare human lives in wars. It seems like he had a lot he wanted to say about battle mechs. His most recent lecture the previous year, 1899, on his experiments and inventions in wireless robotics had been poorly received for being too fantastic for among other things imagining life to be some type of rotating magnetic field. It was his ninth^* public lecture and the first one that had been received poorly instead of enthusiastically. It was also his last lecture. Like his 7th lecture, it was never published, but while his 7th is [available to purchase](http://www.tfcbooks.com/mall/more/351ntl.htm), his 9th is not available anywhere.

94,"Yeah, I assume this is fake. This 3,6,9 stuff is numerology. I've never been able to find a reference for Tesla ever saying it. It seems like something the internet made up and attributed to Tesla because he did prefer numbers divisible by 3 and was supposedly obsessed with triplicating certain actions and not many people are familiar with what he actually said. This similar [spiral multiplication map](http://www.intmath.com/blog/mathematics/real-story-behind-tesla-map-multiplication-chart-10889) was a photoshop hoax."
95,"The first part about Tesla being OCD is right. The rest is a mish-mash of mathematical relationships. The Golden Ratio was an obsession with the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, same with the 3-4-5 triangle.  
  
The mumbo-jumbo is associating Tesla with all the other numerology stuff. Nothing in his writings indicates Tesla had a fixation with numbers beyond using them to describe electrical characteristics.  
  
The problem with Tesla being suppressed for the past 70+ years, unfortunately means a lot of the deranged fringe has latched on to him, so its difficult to separate the psychosis from the history."

^^http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/nt_on_ac.htm

His global power idea was to use the whole planet as a single-conductor transmission line resonator like a G-line but for ELF-VLF surface waves instead of microwaves (specifically 6 Hz to approximately 20 kHz especially 4-12 kHz according to [his patent](http://www.google.com/patents/US787412)). ^^https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNqo1zaZRTYC&pg=PA193  
^^http://ptp.irb.hr/upload/mape/kuca/07_Dmitry_S_Strebkov_SINGLE-WIRE_ELECTRIC_POWER_SYSTEM_FOR_RE.pdf

In using the planet as a transmission line resonator, the atmospheric cosmic rays that play a major role in lightning might be harnessed to contribute to the standing wave. ^^http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~jgladden/phys510/spring06/Gurevich.pdf This is sort of similar to how a traveling wave tube amplifier works but with cosmic rays providing the electrons and only one solid electrode with dielectric atmosphere and ionospheric plasma as the other electrode. Tesla claimed to have successfully harnessed cosmic rays. It is also possible he might have contemplated coupling to some other energy source like the solar wind, the sun or the galactic center. The system transmitted power by resonant surface wave coupling. He could have intended to receive power from some external source by the same mechanism. Without going into detail, he mentioned gathering together latent electricity and harnessing it to produce a 7.5 GW wave using a 7.5 KW input in 1904. https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/cloudborn-electric-wavelets-encircle-globe 

The resonant transmission line method was the primary transmission method, but it probably wasn't the only method the system used. He said he intended for 95% of the energy to be directed to the ground for transmission line resonance by non-radiated/non-Hertzian surface waves, but the other 5% of the output would inevitably radiate as normal/free/Hertzian EM waves. That 5% radiated power could not contribute to the first mode of operation, but it could have been intended to contribute to power transmission by another method. The ionosphere rapidly converts electromagnetic waves into longitudinal/electrostatic waves at electron and ion plasma frequencies (which vary with charge density). ^^http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.1340 He could have contemplated using the ionospheric Alfven resonator or ionospheric heating to contribute to the transmission by harnessing energy from the magnetosphere and/or solar wind. His statements show he was aware of the solar wind, ionospheric dynamo and ducting. He may have used plasma as a filament or column as an antenna or even a conductor. He patented a concept to harness solar wind ions ('radiant energy') in 1901, [US 685,957](https://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/patents/us-p"
97,"The Wardenclyffe tower was the result of Tesla's Colorado Springs tests of wireless transmission of power over long distance. There, his tower, was powered by a Westinghouse hydroelectric power plant that he had designed. At Wardenclyffe, his power was coming from the Niagara Falls power plant that he designed. The power he was using wasn't the power he was transmitting. He was using the local electric power like a priming pump, to use the electric field of the Earth to provide the wide distribution of power.  
  
It needs to be remembered, the late 1800's, was the birth of electromagnetic physics. Physics to that time had been almost completely mechanical, Newtonian, applied to mechanical machines and the planets of the solar system. The development of electromagnetic physics was following the laboratory observations being made, rather than predictive calculations. This was the beginning of the Ivory Tower of Physics.  
  
The main point is Tesla's explanation of how his wireless transmission of power worked was totally rejected by the Ivory Tower of Physics as ridiculous. This was also around the time, these academics were 'proving' heavier than air craft were impossible, that going faster than 60 miles per hour wasn't possible because the air would be sucked out of any enclosure, that rockets would never work in space because there was nothing to 'push against', and was starting to use radium to make watch dials fluorescent.  
  
When JP Morgan pulled the financing for the Wardenclyffe tower from under Tesla, this caused the Ivory Tower of Physics to totally blackball Tesla, that his explanation of physics were the delusions of a mad man, and firmly stating the tower would never have worked anyway.  
  
The interesting epilogue is the electric 'grid' of today is almost entirely comprised of Tesla inventions. While he  didn't invent AC, he did invent high voltage high frequency AC. Tesla invented every aspect of wired distribution of power. As soon as he did that, he determined it was obsolete. He then invented wireless transmission of power. Even before he was finished with that, he determined that was obsolete. He determined there was no need to distribute power, that power was available at any point, that space-time has a flux density. That is where we are today."

99,"This is the article by a radio pioneer that says Marconi didn't invent radio like everyone said he did.

>Marconi played the part of a salesman, and, as is still often the case where scientists and salesmen are involved, the salesman got money out of it while the scientists didn't. Also, as part of the promotion scheme for getting money, Marconi was advertised as deserving the honor for what the scientists had done, making him appear as a profound scientist and almost supernatural inventor.

>The scheme was to make it appear that Marconi had invented radio and thereby get a world wide radio patent monopoly. That was the beginning of many duplicated attempts to advertise inventions and inventors for the purpose of getting a monopoly of radio, or to sell stock. It has been tried more or less right up to this very minute. In the United States, however, the patents were shown up for what they were worth, or avoided by making other devices that would serve the same purpose.

>The virtue of the Marconi Company's advertising was in the publicity it gave to radio and not in the claims they made for themselves. That publicity started quite active development of radio in several countries. It put more money and people into the developing of this so-called new science.

>The advertising brought radio to the attention of people in all walks of life, including numerous unattached young would-be scientists and engineers, who, like Marconi, as yet had no scientific or engineering reputations to lose, and therefore, could take a chance in this new field.

>It became obvious to many that radio could be useful if properly applied. Its apparent possibilities made it an easy thing for stock jobbers to sell stock in radio companies. They were inclined to depart very widely from the kind of rules laid down in Christian Sunday schools in disposing of their stocks, however. Radio was an obviously fertile field, but without immediate returns in it.

Marriott doesn't give Tesla due credit for inventing the four-circuit radio concept in 1893 instead crediting Mahlon Loomis and Hertz for doing more than they really contributed, but he did deny the popularly believed claim that Marconi played any significant role in the invention of radio, and this was a long time before the Supreme Court ruled Marconi's four-circuit radio patent had been anticipated by Tesla (and subsequently Stone).

Hertz did originate the concept of signaling by electromagnetic waves, but Hertz's resonator was astoundingly inefficient only transmitting 35-45 milliwatts. Tesla figured out how to use sharp/resonant tuning to build a multi-kilowatt radio transmitter and apply multi-circuit resonance to improve radio to make long range radio practical. Loomis, Hertz, Stubblefield and Stone all deserve mention in the history of radio, but Tesla invented practical radio single-handedly following Hertz's demonstration of rudimentary wireless signaling.

101,"Tesla's wireless power experiments had previously inspired another wireless power transmission method, near-field highly coupled magnetic resonant wireless power transmission. That method can only transmit power to one receiver per transmitter, because they have to be tuned precisely to resonate their coupled coils. 

This Zenneck surface wave method has the advantage of allowing one transmitter to transmit to multiple receivers because it doesn't require precise tuning to the coupled values. 

This paper is about using conductors as the surface wave radiator. It says the actual conductance of the conductor can be low like an iron railway or the iron frame of a building. 

The experiments in this paper don't use the ground or a body of water as a waveguide. That's what Tesla was talking about. 

[The Corums surface wave experiment](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Surface-waves-and-the-%E2%80%98crucial%E2%80%99-propagation-%E2%80%94-The-Corum-Corum/facbabfb0e030f0c7a5507b72c278692536f716c) showed the surface wave at 52 MHz over water is  
very efficient up to 20 m (>95%),  
fairly efficient up to 100 m (>85% efficient),

and still works up to 4 km (5%).  

It works better over water. The range over land would be shorter."

103,"It's only more evidence of how much of Tesla's life has been almost completely wiped out from American history books and the educational system. Tesla is popularized now but very few get beyond the Wardenclyffe bankruptcy, except agreeing he became a lonely, tortured, crazy mad scientist and died forgotten in a flea bag hotel.  
  
Tesla was fiercely active until he died in 1943. In 1900, the automobile was barely working, Benz using the compression of oil vapor and air for ignition. Many were trying to use chemical ignition. It's no accident that after Tesla went bankrupt in 1899 that the 'spark coil' started showing up for the internal combustion engine. That 'spark coil' was a Tesla coil.  
  
Now, the time is getting into the 20's. Edison and Ford were extremely close friends but they did have a rivalry going on with Edison wanting an electric car rather than Ford's internal combustion engine car. The main reason, back then, was cars had electric ignition but it was strictly with an Edison battery, which had to be recharged at a recharge station. Edison felt it might as well be an electric car and charge the whole battery bank at a station. That is a whole other story in itself. Remember, Edison still hated Tesla with a passion at this point.  
  
Ford found out about some magneto that Tesla was working on and had one of his engineers go find out about it. That became the magneto in the Model-T, which was key to its success. Later, a DC starter motor and an AC alternator replaced the magneto system.  
  
The facts about Tesla after the Wardenclyffe bankruptcy was J.P. Morgan wasn't just a bank. JP Morgan was THE bank back then. Not only that, Edison hated Tesla. While Edison was brilliant, he was also nasty, vindictive and vengeful. Add to that, the New Math physicists had blacklisted Tesla.  
  
So, there is Tesla in the 1920's, the roaring 20's, with Edison, JP Morgan, the entire Physics Ivory Tower, all his to-the-death enemies. He never considered them enemies but they all hated him.  
  
After 1950, almost all evidence for a Tesla ever existing had been nearly cleansed out of 'Murica.

105,"Tesla wasn't producing lightning bolts. Lightning bolts are Direct Current (DC) and actually static electricity, high voltage and low(er) current. In nature, the lightning bolt delivers a huge amount of current but that is in proportion to the static charge developer, clouds.  
  
Tesla's electric bolts are High Frequency, High Voltage Alternating Current (AC). They still seek ground potential and ionize air like a DC lightning bolt. However, it's the HV HF AC that allows transmission of power through air through varying electric potential, why it only took a pole to extract the energy from the air."
106,">At night, many of the popping and crackling sounds of sferics take on a pinging/dripping sound, called ""tweeks,"" and can be quite musical sounding. Recordings of tweeks slowed down about 8 times sound vaguely like ""Chinese Opera"" gongs. Tweeks are a result of the impulse path from the lightning stroke to the receiver being influenced by the Earth surface-to-ionosphere (D and E-layers) region, which is about 4575 miles (7320 Km.) in height, measured vertically during the nighttime hours. This region between the lower ionosphere and surface of the Earth acts as a ""duct"" or ""waveguide"" at these VLF radio frequencies, which have wavelengths ranging from 18 miles/29 km. at 10 kHz to over 186 miles/289 km. @ 1 kHz, allowing lightning stroke impulse energy to travel considerably farther than during the daytime. As the lightning stroke radio energy travels and is reflected within this Earth-ionosphere waveguide, the energy undergoes a slight ""dispersion"" effect whereby the higher frequencies of the lightning impulse arrive slightly before the lower ones within a fraction of a second. The waveguide dispersion effect abruptly cuts off below about 1.5 to 2 kHz (1,500 to 2,000 Hz) in frequency, resulting in the ringing/pinging ""tweek"" sound which is also centered around 1.5-2 kHz. This ringing/pinging ""tweek"" sound you hear is the lowest resonance frequency of the ionosphere-Earth surface waveguide. This is similar effect to what sound waves experience in a pipeline. If you have ever clapped your hands inside a pipeline that was between 1 to 3 feet in diameter, you will notice a sound somewhat similar to the radio sound of tweeks. Because the Earth surface to ionosphere waveguide cannot support radio energy below about 1.5 kHz, the dispersion effect is cutoff below that frequency, thus creating the resonance-like pinging and ringing sound.

>The sounds of tweeks can change on an hourly basis and from night to night, with the ringing and pinging effect very intense and musical at times, especially in the middle of the night in summer and autumn when there is a higher density of relatively strong sferics. Only a few pops and crackles of sferics may be ""tweeking,"" or all of them can be, and the tweeks may sound ""crusty"" or be very clean pings and rings. Tweeks can be indicators of the condition and height of the lower layers of the ionosphere to researchers, but to many listeners to them, they also contribute to the aesthetic sound of Natural Radio. 

>In addition to the musical pinging, dripping, popping and crashing sounds of lightning sferics and tweeks, you may be rewarded by hearing downward falling musical notes ranging from nearly pure to ""swishy"" or ""breathy"" sounding tones from 1/2 to over 4 seconds in duration. These are the aforementioned ""whistlers,"" and they may sometimes happen a couple of seconds after some of the static crashes and pops of sferics from lightning strokes.

The association with the Academic Physics community back then is more complex, but he was essentially black listed by the Physics intelligentsia. Einstein wrote Eo = m, the world went wild, Tesla said the equation didn't say much beyond energy-mass equivalency, which the 1st Law of Thermodynamics had already clarified.  
  
Tesla was extremely well educated, he was not a barnyard mechanic like Edison. This was another reason Edison resented Tesla so much, that Tesla was 'book learned'.  This photo shows Tesla reading a book to show the scale of one of his coils. The book is James Clerk Maxwell's ""Scientific Papers"".

And Schrodinger, De Broglie, Dirac and others reintroduced pieces of Tesla's ideas over the following decades. Less certainly there is a small mystery why Trkal's curl eigenfunctions were better known in the US than in Europe when Trkal was Czech. It would be surprising if Tesla were not the reason.

113,"This patent describes a multi-core transformer that is also a tiny nuclear fission reactor. The central core is made of unenriched radioisotopes rather than the laminated iron of the other cores. The radioactive core consists of eight small uranium rods spaced equally and packed in powdered thorium in a hollow cardboard tube structure to hold it together. Thorium and uranium are paramagnetic, so it works basically the same as a regular magnetic core. There are coils wound inside the core and outside it. 

A central radium needle is used as the primary source of energetic particles. These particles strike the thorium-uranium core where nuclear reactions produce additional particle radiation that irradiates the two rings of transformers that surround the central transformer with the radioactive core. The particle energy is absorbed by the fields of the current in the conductors of the transformers where they produce secondary electrons that amplify the current.

The magnetic fields of the coils on the radioactive core should deflect the radiation somewhat, but the patent doesn't mention this or if that matters. The core is magnetized while radiation bombards it and reactions take place in it. That also might be an important part of how it works.

An example prototype mentioned in the patent using a core 6"" (15 cm) long produced 23 A, 400 V (9.2 kW) at 86 kHz using 200 g unenriched uranium, 100 g thorium and 0.001 Ci (1 mCi) radium. It says the output could be continuous duty with sufficient cooling. 

The tuning shifts over time as the core decays changing its magnetic properties. Smart electronics would need to accommodate the shift for a consumer product that doesn't require periodic maintenance tuning several times per year to keep the power output up. 

The device is intended to be immersed in oil with some means of active cooling necessary for large output power. Brown said he had a lot of problems with large power units overheating. The patent described that 9 kW device using 12 gauge wire (2 mm diameter). The wire probably needs to be considerably heavier to avoid overheating.

The coil and the oil and everything would become contaminated radioactive waste over time from the neutron radiation. It's not high level waste like spent enriched fuel rods, but it would all be highly irradiated, so it would need to be collected for proper disposal. The amount of power for the waste produced is probably better than conventional nuclear energy, and the waste is much less dangerous, but unfortunately there is still some low level nuclear waste with this. The radon and other gases that accumulate in it are probably among the most hazardous parts especially because it could eventually become pressurized with a mix of radon, thoron and helium.

The cylindrical elements are oriented coaxially to the secondary winding (2) and serve as interlayer insulation of the secondary winding (2), their thickness and height increasing towards the primary winding (1). The flat annular elements (6) are arranged symmetrically in relation to the axis of the transformer and to the plane which is oriented at right angles to that axis and passes through the center of the secondary winding (2). The diameters of the annular layers (6) are increasing towards the butt-ends of the secondary winding (2) corresponding to the increase of the cylindrical layers so that the section composed of the cylindrical elements contacts with the section composed of the flat annular elements (6) along stepped surfaces (7).

118,"There seems to be a lot of hype riding on this and their experimental methods would appear to leave a lot to be desired, so I wouldn't expect it to pan out under scrutiny. Practical forms of EM propulsion may be possible (like especially Coulombic propulsion), but this probably wasn't proof. I thought I'd share it anyway because it's big news and kind of Tesla-y, and who knows? Maybe it is real."
119,"> [A] Low cost and low losses single-wire electric power system (SWEPS) for renewable-based electric grid was developed. The new technology of electric power transmission uses [the] idle operation regime of the transmission line and reactive capacitive current for transmission of active electric power. Three different SWEPS were constructed and tested: 230V, 10kV and 100kV each is of one kilowatt capacity. [The] Resonance mode of oscillation with frequency from 3 to 30 kHz was used to provide the most efficient power transmission. [A] Frequency converter and modified Tesla transformer are applied at the generator site to generate high frequency reactive capacitive current. Reversal [step-down] Tesla transformer and standard rectifier and invertor were used at the user?s end to convert the reactive high frequency electric power to standard 50-60 Hz electricity. It was experimentally proved that SWEPS has [a] quasi-superconductivity property for reactive capacitive current flow along the line even at high operation temperature of the electric conductor. SWEPS has no resistance losses for following tested conductor materials of the line: copper, aluminum, steel, tungsten, carbon, water, damp soil. The principle of SWEPS operation is based on the fact, that in no load operation mode the active current and magnetic field of a single-wire line is equal to zero, while the electric field of the conductor has [a] maximum value and this electric field is exited by reactive current which is charging the capacitance of the single-wire line and the electric load. The result of theoretical calculation and experimental study shows that SWEPS can be applied both for the energy transmission from renewable powerful generation site to a large energy system and for transmission lines for connecting different parts of renewable energy system.

This says conduction resistance can be avoided by using reactive current instead of conduction current. This is apparently easily accomplished by using VLF instead of ELF and by using the transmission line more like a capacitor. The conventional dogma has been to avoid reactive current because resonant voltage rise tends to break things. Applying this idea will make superconducting-performance transmission lines cheaper than current non-superconducting lines. This allows environmentally friendlier energy sources to be transmitted from where power can be produced efficiently to where it is wanted.

In other words, this essentially says power transmission engineering has been in the grip of the Edison-era paradigm of fear of transmission line resonance, which is unfortunate because it would allow current to flow without resistance (like superconductivity) but at high temperatures (no cryogenics)."

He single-handedly lit up the Chicago World's Fair with carbon button and fluorescent bulbs. And yet, somehow, the whole planet ended up using filament light bulbs for a century, all designed to burn out in 2 to 5 years.

So many people are making a campaign about 'debunking' Tesla, that he didn't invent AC. These people are the same ones that are wrapped up in flat Earth delusions, fake Moon landings, literal Noah, what passes for 'average intelligence' in 2016. Tesla didn't invent AC but he most certainly invented High Frequency High Voltage Alternating Current. He also developed all the mathematics behind Power Electronics, mainly complex impedances of capacitors and inductors, resistive and tuned loads. His invention of the rotating magnetic field wasn't really an invention. He saw immediately the principles he was discovering were describing nature. His stick drawings in the park where the rotating magnetic field came to him, is at the heart of many areas of astrophysics, with pulsars, quasars and magnetars.  Physics is in a quandry right now, coming up with all kinds of contrivances to make things work, like 'dark matter','dark energy', 'black holes', 'supermassive black holes'. The Ivory Tower of physics rejected Tesla and he didn't really care, he pitied them for not understanding. What he said was simple and also why they rejected him. Tesla referred to the ether and by 'modern' 1920's physics, the ether was a silly artificial gizmo used by earlier scientists that didn't know better. Tesla tried to make it clear he was not referring to the ether like the earlier scientists, his ether was space-time, and that space-time is filled with extremely high frequency energy, that is, space-time was dynamic, not uniformly static.  
  
Look at anything HF HV and at the heart, there is almost always a Tesla coil. This is very interesting Russian research, and they are acknowledging Tesla which is even more interesting. Edison's power didn't extend to Russia or China. Now, there is this recent news about a gigantic power network between Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. If these guys wrote a paper about an operational prototype, combined with that multi-national energy distribution agreement, considering the vast distances involved, wow! If that is what is going on, it is going to be a mind-blower and the US is going to be caught with its obsolete Edison boxer shorts down. "
121,"This is the common science fiction concept of an explode-y destructive force field?not to be confused with the more common non-destructive pushy force field concept.

Calling it a 'wall' would appear to be Tesla's colorful way of characterizing his [1935 'Teleforce' proposal](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1935-00-00.htm) (he was then 79), which was apparently a particle accelerator energy beam weapon. Even though it was a beam weapon, he characterized the invention as producing a 'wall': ""It will be possible to destroy anything approaching within 200 miles.  My invention will provide a wall of power."" This was one of Tesla's later inventions to try to eliminate war. That's probably why he would focus on its defensive capability exclusively.

Besides that explodey force field, the more familiar sci-fi non-destructive pushy force field has actually been realized in a form by workers at a South Carolina factory who were repackaging wide polypropylene film in 1980. The electrostatic field produced was so strong that a person could not push through it. http://amasci.com/weird/unusual/e-wall.html That sounds like it could be made into an electrostatic trampoline or something like that.

Tesla's teleforce invention used a megavolt-range electrostatic generator too, so it's possible he might have intended to produce a pushy force field too, but he never mentioned that aspect.

\* It's probably worth noting he was talking about this idea during the period leading up to the second world war. And it was a military/defense idea rather than intended to control immigration.

Here's something some Tesla authors wrote about it for a PBS show: ""[A Weapon to End War](http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_wendwar.html)."""
122,"This is a description by a reporter, not from Tesla directly, although he may have said ""like a"" before 'wall of force'. It was news to me to find out Tesla was writing many heads of state in the mid 1930's warning of the coming war and how he could prevent it from happening.  The news picked up on it as the ""death ray"" but Tesla was so upset with that portrayal that he pointed out rays wouldn't have enough energy, that he was directing a stream of highly charged particles, a beam about the diameter of a pencil, out to several hundred miles. The charged particle beam would only be the diameter of a bullet but it would cut through anything including engine blocks and air frames. Tesla really got upset with the news constantly describing it as a ""death ray"", that he sent a clarification letter, stating it used charged particles. This is the later 30's now and he had started writing letters to every world leader except Hitler and Mussolini, offering to come to their nation and build the particle beam weapon. He was in deep negotiations with Neville Chamberlain, and the deal was almost signed, when Chamberlain pulled out, saying the Nazi's would never invade Poland. Details are sketchy but Russia did hire him for $25,000 and he traveled to Russia to work on some system, although it doesn't seem to be the charged particle beam weapon. His work in Russia was a scalar directed energy weapon. It was like two Tesla coils that could focus their discharges together and send lightning bolts into the sky.  
  
When he returned, he kept writing letters about the charged particle beam weapon, this time, with detailed drawings of the components. The design is interesting because it was after he had spent almost a decade with his turbine, then years of studying properties of different materials. The charged particle beam uses advanced Tesla turbines providing the enormous amount of static electrical charge. Tesla said he got the inspiration from watching a Van Degraff generator. There are copies of the letters around.  "
123,"For bonus historical points, the thieves could rebrand it as a Marconi (or Thomson or Pupin) and claim that they invented it. And if it were really Tesla's, they would get away with it.

This joke gets posted here every two months. That's more often than I'd prefer, because it's about the company except for vaguely referencing the dump Edison took on Tesla's career, but unless someone else has valid complaints about it, I don't care enough to do anything about it.

124,"This patent says a thunderstorm dissipates on average 50 GWh of electric, which would cost $5 million at $.10/KWh (a little less than consumers pay for electric).

Their idea of harnessing lightning directly seems very dangerous and difficult. As [other atmospheric electric harnessing inventions posted here show](/r/Tesla/comments/55g6q5/teslas_version_of_maxwells_demon_cooling_for/), there are easier ways to harness the atmospheric energy that gives rise to lightning instead of waiting until the energy has become extremely concentrated as a lightning bolt to try to capture and store it in what must be a very expensive capacitor."

127,"As I'm answering these questions, it was just announced that Queen Elizabeth has died. Coincidentally, when Elizabeth was 10 years old, that would be in 1936, Tesla was writing to the British War Office essentially pleading with them to purchase the details to his particle beam weapon because Tesla feared that the Nazis might invade their island by air and sea and it was Tesla's contention that his particle beam weapon would indeed protect the country from such a horrible fate. I get into this in great detail in my new book TESLA: WIZARD AT WAR."
128,"If true, staging a deception, no matter the motivation does not make it not a deception.

129,"This is a good explanation of what the 3-6-9 business could be about, but it contains a glaring error. This guy never mentioned that no one has ever provided the source for this supposed quotation. Without a source, there is no reason to think the quote is real. It appears to be fabricated or at least misattributed. It sounds more like Walter Russell than Tesla.

Tesla said a lot of very interesting things about physics and metaphysics, like about the nature of energy, radiation, cosmology, gravity, quantum mechanics, etc. but it's remarkably difficult to find any real information about that on the internet. It is available to read and attempt to interpret, but if you're interested in learning more about his thoughts, you're inundated by thousands of links about this numerology stuff that doesn't actually seem to be connected to Tesla at all. It almost seems like the point of it is to suppress interest in Tesla and consideration of the things he really did say.

One useful thing about this is that it makes it easy to identify people who actually care about the information enough to know this is not correctly attributed to Tesla. If someone is talking about this vortex math and Tesla, you know they believe any random thing they read so they probably don't know what they're talking about and they probably don't have anything interesting to say."

He is also now buying the boring company with Tesla money most likely because the boring company is a flop and being he owns 90% of the said company. He will be paying top dollar I am sure. More billions in his pocket at the cost to Tesla shareholders for a failed company. 

Also bought Solar City when it was failing from his cousin (whom I suspect Elon of bankrolling), at a premium as it had no real IP or benefits that could not be started from scratch.

131,"if you?re wondering how this could be metered, it is entirely possible to encrypt the power signal by rapidly changing across frequency spectrums at a specific ?random? short bursts that only someone who has a purchased encryption key box that wirelessly meters the receiver for all power in and out and only allows the subscriber to know the ?rolling frequency? encryption key if they?ve paid up on their previous months bill. With modern frequency controllers this is a piece of cake actually. And that?s just one way to encrypt the power signal. There are soo many others. With modern frequency controllers the power signal can be encrypted in various ways, such as wideband ?random rolling/frequency sweeping? that a user has to have the wireless box that meters and provides the rolling encryption key to the receiver to constantly be able to match the tuning to actually put a load on it. Rolling even just 100 discrete and dissonant frequencies every second would make it so someone who doesn?t have the key can only catch it once a second and can only pull power across a load for 1/100th of a second every second. Random roll between 1000 discrete and dissonant frequencies? even harder to chase the encryption. The higher that number goes the harder it is for someone to leech from the system. This is quite literally a wideband Pulse width modulation for power distribution encryption. And transmitting frequencies are so high you would have 1000s if not millions of current pulses for each 1/1000th of a second that each discrete and dissonant frequency is on for. So this rolling power encryption wouldn?t have cutoffs in between changes either.

Check out the full post I made about using Tesla?s magnifying transmitter for ground electrical power transmission. I give an at length explanation in the description.

And being the center of attention makes him feel important, special and fulfils some of his social needs, but it's never going to truly satisfy him since he fails to connect with people in a truly meaningful way.

He's basically just a lonely person jumping onto a table in a crowded restaurant and beginning to yell to satisfy his social needs."
133,"Thomas Henry Moray was one of the many early 20th century inventors called cranks for claiming to discover a new source of energy. Moray's claims are among the best supported. He performed numerous demonstrations and obtained statements from professors and respected authorities like judges and politicians to witness and vouch for the validity of his demonstrations. 

He was apparently never able to patent his energy device as an energy device. The only patent he ever obtained was this patent for electrotherapeutic apparatus, but these corona discharge capacitors are the essential concept of his energy device too. 

The tube on the left is an air capacitor with one electrode inside a vacuum tube. It is also a type of corona discharge ozone generator, but this patent doesn't mention that fact. I haven't found the first ozone generator with this design yet, but I'm pretty sure something very similar had already been patented as an ozone generator a long time before 1943. Tesla patented a corona discharge ozone generator in 1896 ([US568177](https://patents.google.com/patent/US568177)), but not with this vacuum tube air capacitor element. 

As an air capacitor, it does not charge by normal current alone like a normal capacitor. It appears to be capable of multiplying charge from ionizing light ionizing the air between the electrodes. This is not how Moray explained it's functioning, but it might explain how it generated energy. This would defy known laws of physics, but it has the advantage of being a very simple explanation. 

Another possibility, consider what capacitors like these can do in light of the concept presented in Stan Deyo's patent application ([US20080191580A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080191580A1)). Moray's spark capacitor carries an oscillating electrostatic field, which can harness the significant ambient energy in the range of 4.5-7 MHz that varies with atmospheric conditions that Deyo described. Deyo said he got that idea from an associate of Tesla related to a certain infamous politician. 

Moray's choice of the term radiant energy is Tesla's term ([US685957](https://patents.google.com/patent/US685957), [US685958](https://patents.google.com/patent/US685958)). All their other technical nomenclature is identical too. The date of Moray's application for this?his only patent he successfully obtained?was only a few months after Tesla died. That's interesting. 

This must be what Tesla had in mind with his radiant energy patents or what he evolved the concept into. The central concept in Moray's patent is charging a capacitor with ionizing light, which was one of the claims of Tesla's radiant energy patents. 

Moray described the process in the short booklet he wrote in 1926 (published in 1931), *[Beyond The Light-Rays: Explanations of the Oscillations of Radiant Energy](http://www.rexresearch.com/beyond/beyond.htm)*. He included Tesla's wheelwork of nature quote. ""Throughout space there is energy. [...] it is a mere questi"

Possibly, too, power may travel through the air when means are found to prevent enormous voltages being suddenly discharged in the wrong place.

[W. L. George. What the world will be like in a hundred years. *New York Herald*. May 7, 1922.](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83045774/1922-05-07/ed-1?sp=87&r=0.103,1.108,0.354,0.214,0)

I think that article was saying what one of the main problems with Tesla's long-range power transmission method was: the transmitted energy could escape as unpredictable lightning. 

When Tesla came back to wireless power transmission in 1920, after Wardenclyffe was demolished in 1917, he was working on his single-wire transmission line to power vehicles in motion. And in 1921, Hermann Plauson included the idea for a 1-100 km coil that would transmit wireless power everywhere within it. These simpler induction methods don't require the atmosphere to be a better insulator than it is."
136,"I disagree.

This was our chance to do something constructive, aka actually work towards fixing the problem.  We didn't.

Twitter could be percieved as politically biased based on who they were banning and who they werent. 

You don't have to agree with republican viewpoints, but, Twitter needs customers.  Musk wants it to be more profitable, so he fired everyone who made it the way it was and wants to start fresh. Everyone saying they are quitting Twitter is making it better, as crappy as that sounds to some. 

Twitter needs to be a social space for conversation free of bias to make good money. I see what Musk is doing."

The value of twitter is not in the infrastructure, it's in the users and the advertisement dollars directed

idols.

If Musk lets Twitter descend to the natural state of uncensored hate, it will deteriorate to the level
of parler or truth social where only the deplorables will congregate and the only advertisers will
be grifters taking money from the deplorables."

151,"In 1958 in Birmingham, AL, a celebration of the city's most famous person and a parade was planned to honor the great Willie Mays.  But literally an hour before it was to start, the City's infamous Director of Public Safety, Bull Connor (the man behind using attack dogs and fire hoses on civil rights marchers) cancelled the parade, even though the streets were packed and the bands were lined up to start marching.  Willie never spoke of this again."

211,"According to a report from the Goldwater Institute, the judge found that the ?Super Bowl Censorship Ordinance? violated the free speech rights of citizens.

It also ?unconstitutionally delegated power to the National Football League (NFL) and Super Bowl Host Committee,? the report said.

The institute had sued the city because its new rule ?barred residents from placing signs on their own property without first getting approval from the NFL and the Host Committee ? two private entities that were empowered to choose what kind of speech people were allowed to engage in,? the report said.

But that amounted to ?an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech and an unconstitutional delegation of power.?"

229,"Republican senators say that administration officials didn't dismiss the possibility that U.S. manufacturing aided in construction of the Chinese surveillance balloon in a classified briefing with senators on Thursday. 

Following a classified briefing Thursday with officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) the Department of Defense (DOD) and the State Department, Senators Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska., said that the question of whether American companies helped build the Chinese surveillance balloon was raised in the briefing, and the officials didn't answer definitively. 

""American companies shouldn't be helping build spy satellites that are used against their own citizens,"" Sullivan told reporters at the Capitol after the briefing.  ""Maybe there's nothing to be said about that,"" he said, ""but somebody asked about it, and nobody, nobody in that briefing said, 'oh, it's not a problem.'""

We must also consider this possibility.

China is currently flying a spy balloon over the US most sensitive sites, with a focus on the missile wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where the US houses a large number of its intercontinental missiles.

While the Whitehouse/Pentagon/MSM mouthpiece is busy making excuses about its limited ability to obtain data and how shooting the balloon down in the middle of nowhere is somehow dangerous to non-existent civilians, the balloon's actual goal of creating High Definition maps of the underground silos using an advance EM/GPR/ Acoustic Light penetrative field (DAS) has already been completed."

?You need to leave, you just need to leave. This is a matter of life and death,? DeWine said at news conference.

Officials warned the controlled burn would send phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the air. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas that can cause vomiting and breathing trouble and was used as a weapon in World War I.

The list of exculpatory evidence Sidney Powell demanded reveals that Flynn knew documents existed that would prove that President Obama and his administration co-conspirators, aided by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, had engaged in treasonous activity.  It was also apparent how desperately the Obama administration had worked to keep the requested documents from the American public.

There are claims that Nord Stream was attacked by our own allies.

There are charges that the United States of America and the Kingdom of Norway planned and carried out an explosive attack on Nord Stream.

This accusation was made by a US citizen: award-winning journalist Seymour Hersh.

In an article published Wednesday, Hersh cites a source who appears to have had direct knowledge of the planning of the operation.

Hersh claims the United States and Norway arranged for explosives to be planted on both Nord Stream pipelines during a NATO naval maneuver in the Baltic Sea last summer, which was remotely detonated a few months later.

The White House and the CIA deny these allegations.

?Of course Bellingcat doesn?t like Seymour Hersh because his reporting undermines the narrative of the U.S. security state and western media outlets?, Greenwald said.

?The people who have lied the most, who have spread the most conspiracy theories, are the ones who have been promoted an enriched most within corporate journalism?, Greenwald said. ?That?s the only way to get ahead.? The difference is, ?you have to spread lies and conspiracy theories on behalf of the CIA, and that advance the interests of the US government. That is not only permitted, that?s required to be promoted?, according to Greenwald."

272,Because even from the UK I could see how trump smashed it! He literally had peace in the middle east for 4 years as well as having putting and Kim under control he was the alpha male! And everyone was scared of him...
273,Normal people are too soft and lazy.  They will tolerate a *lot* of corruption from public officials as long as they are kept distracted by bread and circuses.  Otherwise there would be regular protests in the streets.
274,"You see Washington DC in its entirety is corrupt, so when someone comes on who is not corrupt they get scared. So they will destroy the entire country before letting someone not corrupt to take the helm again"
275,The FBI had the evidence that there was ?no conspiracy? or plans made by the Proud Boys and others to invade and take control of the US Capitol.  The FBI ignored this information from their own operative.  They ran with lies about an insurrection instead.
276,"Because people that put him in power have infiltrated every level of our government - they have puppets EVERYWHERE including in the Republican Party. The actual agendas don?t align with Republican v. Democrat. Also, there is no public outrage because the media is also controlled and REFUSES to discuss it!!! For liberal people - who now hate Elon Musk and literally think he is the devil incarnate and the most evil person on the planet - they left Twitter before the files dropped!!! And bc it isn?t covered in the media, to them, they know nothing. The media controls what the majority of people think and believe. Whatever the television says goes. Without the media pointing out that the election was stolen, Biden can do no wrong. They also believe that Biden literally RESCUED out country from Nazis!!!! Biden could kill someone live on television and they would still follow him and support him. It doesn?t matter because they are completely asleep. AND, again, with people backing this agenda (ultimately NWO and 1 world government) in every level and branch of the American government, there?s not a damn thing that will be done about it. The allegiance is not to the American people. It is to the NWO."
277,"Mixture of corruption, cowardice incompetence in the White House is causing a shitstorm everywhere else in the world. 

Not giving house or senate republicans any faith, but still gotta hope they?ll kick out all of biden?s corruption keys and get him out."
